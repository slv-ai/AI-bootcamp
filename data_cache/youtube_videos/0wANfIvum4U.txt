0:48 and yeah i think i said last but this is
0:50 a slide i added recently because we are
0:53 launching a
0:54 a course a free course about ml ops
0:58 so if you know what mlops is check it
1:00 out if you do not know what hemologs is
1:02 also check it out it's a course about
1:04 productionizing machine learning so the
1:06 link is also in the description
1:08 and then
1:10 during the interview today if you have
1:12 any questions
1:14 there is a pinned link in the live chat

1:20 these questions during the interview
1:22 so i think that's all for the
1:25 introduction
1:27 so now i need to
1:28 get my notes
1:32 okay
1:34 so i have my notes and
1:37 i
1:38 think i'm ready are you ready
1:40 yeah
1:42 okay uh just one second
1:46 i'm just trying to
1:50 like zoom looks different like weird for
1:52 me okay now it's good so let's start
1:55 yeah
1:57 so this week we'll talk about um this
2:00 week we'll talk about becoming a data
2:02 engineer
2:03 data engineer or analyst and we have a
2:06 special guest today gloria gloria works
2:08 as a business data analyst at ice i
2:10 don't know if i pronounce name correctly
2:12 is it ice or
2:13 nice nice
2:15 like ice cube ice cream right exactly
2:17 before working at ice she was a
2:20 researcher and at some point she decided
2:22 to change her career and she enrolled in
2:24 a data science bootcamp she'll probably
2:26 tell us more about that today so welcome
2:29 to our event
2:31 many thanks for having me
2:33 so before we go into our main topic of
2:36 today let's start with your background
2:37 can you tell us about your career
2:39 journey so far
2:41 uh yeah so i originally studied biology
2:44 and psychology in the united states and
2:45 then decided to continue that track by
2:48 pursuing a master's in neuroscience
2:50 here in europe and after my master's i
2:52 decided to join a research group
2:55 here in germany in another city in
2:57 magdeburg and i worked in that
2:58 laboratory for three years the
3:01 the research i concentrated on was um
3:04 kind of examining
3:06 the effects of dopamine on a long-term
3:08 potentiation or how memory is formed
3:09 essentially
3:11 um throughout my time there um i did
3:13 realize that after a while i did have
3:16 more of like um i guess of a passion for
3:19 for the technical stuff rather than the
3:21 theoretical you know scientific uh or
3:23 biological background
3:24 of my research um and also while i was
3:27 there on my last year um i had to
3:29 establish a technique and i had um and
3:32 so i had to uh
3:34 like you know build a lot of my own
3:36 apparatuses of reconfigure machinery and
3:38 one of the things also was to learn how
3:40 to program in this
3:42 c language so i could do some data
3:43 analysis and um and that part i really
3:46 enjoyed very much and i realized you
3:48 know um this is what i really wanted to
3:50 do on the long term and that um in the
3:52 in academic research fields it this was
3:55 not like so much a possibility for me
3:57 and i wanted to you know go to a field
3:59 where i have more possibilities so i
4:01 decided you know um at the end of my
4:04 third year contract to to not renew it
4:06 um and then and continue start doing the
4:08 um you know the career transition
4:11 um and so i uh i eventually found this
4:15 data science bootcamp uh here in um in
4:17 berlin spiced um and i did that for
4:19 three months and i really did enjoy it i
4:21 learned just so much more much more than
4:23 i had anticipated um and then uh you
4:26 know did the typical job punch you know
4:27 how everyone does and and eventually
4:29 landed my spot at the company um ice as
4:32 a business data analyst
4:35 interesting story so you said you
4:38 needed to configure this machinery and
4:39 write something in the c language what
4:42 kind of how did it look like this
4:43 machinery is it something like you
4:44 attach to your brain or
4:46 uh no so i actually not brain but like
4:50 oh no no so i mean i've done that before
4:52 as well but this one is essentially i
4:54 had to work with
4:55 animal tissue samples i essentially had
4:57 to harvest
4:58 brain slices unfortunately from from
5:00 mice and then i would have to place it
5:03 in this massive microscope apparatus
5:06 and hook up this little tissue sample to
5:08 a bunch of different electrodes and
5:09 wires
5:10 um and then using um using the
5:13 controllers and
5:15 kind of tried to control the voltage and
5:17 current
5:18 that was being passed through the tissue
5:20 and and conduct my proper recordings and
5:22 then collect all that data and analyze
5:24 it
5:26 you needed to use c for for doing this
5:28 for controlling voltage and all that um
5:31 well so now the um the programs that i
5:33 had that were used to actually conduct
5:35 experiments and to do the data
5:36 collection
5:37 i i think i'm they were probably based
5:39 on some kind of c language but this was
5:41 all like you know software it's not open
5:43 source software it's essentially
5:44 software that the laboratory already
5:45 buys and it's configured in the app and
5:47 the apparatuses and everything like that
5:50 the um the the stuff that i had into the
5:52 program was i had to use this um a
5:54 scientific um uh program called igor
5:57 it's not very well known in the open
5:58 source community um but in the
5:59 scientific community it's uh it's pretty
6:01 well known and that program um it has
6:04 like a flavor of c it's not exactly c
6:07 but it's very very close to c
6:10 um and and and i for that program i had
6:12 like a a copy of it on my laptop and it
6:15 was just um the program that i knew i
6:17 could um easily import that the data
6:19 that i recorded to do the analysis so i
6:22 i found this tutorial book on amazon
6:24 ordered it you know i read through it
6:26 and practiced and then gave it a go with
6:28 them building my own little gui and
6:31 analyzing the data
6:33 was it difficult for you like with your
6:35 background to learn to use this was was
6:38 it eager like basically this language
6:41 um so actually i was i was surprised um
6:44 when i first learned a little bit about
6:46 programming as an undergrad um back when
6:48 i was in the united states it was with
6:50 matlab i was working with and i thought
6:52 it was the most horrible thing ever i
6:54 was so petrified by it every time i had
6:56 a course or any kind of class assignment
6:58 to do with it i just froze my
7:00 it was impossible but um when um when i
7:03 picked it up picked up a little bit of
7:04 programming again in in back in
7:06 magdeburg you know in the other city i
7:08 worked at
7:08 um i just gave it a go um and uh and i
7:12 actually enjoyed it quite a bit because
7:14 prior to doing that or in parallel i was
7:16 taking this coursera course to to learn
7:18 r
7:19 and r was actually i felt a little more
7:21 difficult to pick up it's not as uh
7:24 as simple as you know python or c or
7:26 anything like that
7:27 um so when i had to do to work with c in
7:29 this um program igor um it i mean it
7:31 takes quite a bit of practice you know a
7:33 lot of trial and error with anybody who
7:35 does programming they they know that but
7:37 you know if you're really really
7:38 passionate about it and you you really
7:39 are willing to put the hours in to
7:41 practice and stuff it becomes quite you
7:43 know innate and you know normal
7:46 so i know that matlab can be quite
7:48 frightening like especially if you don't
7:51 have any programming background i i also
7:54 needed to use matlab at school but
7:56 that's cool at university for doing some
7:59 signal processing
8:00 and i thought okay why i would torture
8:02 it with this too
8:04 there are other tools that may be better
8:06 okay so what do you do now at ice
8:10 so at the moment um when i first started
8:12 at ice i was hired yes business data
8:14 analyst and i was hired to essentially
8:16 help my co-workers work on we call them
8:18 tickets you know essentially it's both
8:20 internal and external customers they
8:21 come to us
8:23 because we have the sql capacity and
8:25 access the data warehouses in order to
8:27 um to pull their uh to compile the
8:30 reports that they need to then do their
8:31 more i guess like high level analysis
8:34 uh so i did that for the first couple of
8:35 months when um when i started at ice and
8:38 it was more about learning um i mean sql
8:40 i i knew a little bit when i started but
8:42 it's really easy to pick up you get it
8:43 think of it after one or two weeks um
8:46 but it was more of the uh the business
8:47 model that was actually quite complex um
8:50 the they're just like you know um where
8:53 where can i find all the information
8:54 like what parameters do i have to apply
8:56 in the sql statement in order to get the
8:58 the the correct information especially
9:00 for business separation um all this this
9:02 data is not separated you know by a
9:04 customer in different different tables
9:06 they're all just meshed together in
9:07 their respective tables and you have to
9:10 try to make sure that um
9:12 i had to try to make sure that i wasn't
9:14 providing information of one customer to
9:16 another you know external customer
9:19 um so yeah um and i found this out quite
9:22 uh quite difficult at first um and also
9:24 too like taking um scripts that my
9:26 co-workers previously wrote and then
9:27 just re-running them and if a customer
9:30 asks for some kind of alteration i would
9:31 spend the day like just reading and
9:33 understanding the script and then
9:35 finding out how am i supposed to modify
9:36 this script to to be able to deliver you
9:39 know the customer results so that's what
9:41 that's what i did when i first started
9:43 um and then the and also too they're
9:45 also inside projects where we do
9:46 collaborations with other departments
9:48 um and uh usually when i when i work on
9:51 those side projects it's because i have
9:53 you know the the programming capacity
9:55 and the just the access to the data
9:57 warehouse to then provide the um the
9:59 data to i guess the more business
10:01 oriented analysts the ones i have just
10:03 have a uh greater business background in
10:06 terms of the specific data model
10:08 and i worked with them you know to to
10:10 clean up the data fetch it um and also
10:12 they also asked me like for my
10:14 interpretation so i give it a go and um
10:16 and try to get some insights you know do
10:18 some um exploratory and then we we all
10:21 work together to try to i guess uh come
10:24 up with a story you know for the data
10:26 for this specific project
10:28 and now
10:29 yes
10:30 yeah so you
10:31 you need to
10:33 prepare reports so you need to fetch all
10:34 the data in a form that is easy to put
10:37 in the report do you also take care of
10:39 the reports themselves or somebody else
10:41 uses the data to visually arrange
10:44 them usually
10:47 um i usually don't really know what
10:48 happens to the reports after i uh submit
10:50 them to the customer but from what i
10:52 understand um all these customers they
10:54 really don't have any kind of a
10:56 programming capacity so what they
10:58 essentially do is they do a lot of like
11:00 analysis and
11:02 look at the data in excel um
11:04 i i guess they would they would create
11:06 you know their basic graphics what they
11:07 would need in order to present this data
11:09 then to some kind of a stake key
11:10 stakeholder
11:12 uh but in terms of uh um for instance if
11:15 they needed a dashboard we would be the
11:16 ones that would create the dashboard for
11:18 them they would not um do that
11:20 so if they if they were to look at the
11:22 data themselves it would just it's
11:23 mostly just excel
11:26 so for you what you do is uh there are
11:28 some data pipelines so you need to get
11:30 data from a database where that you say
11:34 is a little bit complicated there are
11:36 there is data from different customers
11:39 so you need to carefully get the data
11:40 from there
11:41 clean it prepare it and pass it over to
11:45 somebody who then will analyze this data
11:48 in excel
11:50 yes
11:51 yes
11:53 yeah i'm just curious what actually the
11:55 does the company do you said it's
11:57 something related to
11:59 uh music
12:00 right in music processing so there are
12:02 two sides of the business um that the
12:04 company works in in copyright and online
12:06 um data processing so for the copyright
12:08 side it's essentially it's uh they're
12:10 the data warehouse for um all the um all
12:14 the music metadata from the society from
12:16 societies you know in germany there's
12:18 the gamma society and in the uk there's
12:20 prs
12:21 and sweden there's stem
12:23 and in the united states there's bmg um
12:26 so they so essentially different like
12:28 publishers and societies they feed um
12:31 loads of data to us um in terms of like
12:33 copyright information the names of the
12:35 songs um the creators
12:37 have uh what rights they have to each
12:40 work how much percentage and royalty
12:41 they should be receiving
12:43 so the copyrights are the business they
12:44 take care of all that the online side of
12:46 the business they essentially take um
12:49 reports from these streaming services
12:52 and ingest them and process them
12:55 and then
12:56 they then they fetch the copyright data
12:57 and calculate how much royalty should be
12:59 paid out to each respective creator
13:02 society or publisher
13:05 okay so somebody
13:07 gets a song
13:08 they stream it to the listeners
13:11 and then you need to figure out how many
13:14 listeners saw the song writes so that
13:16 you can calculate
13:18 how much they should
13:20 you know pay right yeah yes so um
13:23 actually the um with the the streaming
13:25 services when they when they send us
13:27 reports they essentially just state how
13:29 many times a given work was was streamed
13:32 uh and so we then we take that that
13:33 quantity and but often times you know
13:35 the the reports are not fully clean um
13:37 uh
13:38 sometimes we need to find ways to
13:40 identify um and identify the work so we
13:42 can match them to the copyright database
13:45 and so after after they do the matching
13:48 then they can determine uh what are the
13:50 percentages in terms of like um
13:52 mechanical rights performing rights you
13:54 know different types of rights and uh
13:56 and how much you know a given artist
13:58 should be receiving based on the stream
14:00 count
14:01 and all that
14:03 you do right all this
14:05 part of this process i guess so you
14:07 receive some data from somebody but you
14:09 need to clean this
14:10 right you need to also match this at
14:13 these things that are sometimes
14:15 difficult to watch right so the uh so
14:17 actually there's a couple hundred people
14:19 that are involved in that whole data
14:21 pipeline uh you know
14:25 like you know ingesting the copyright
14:27 data and making sure that it's correct
14:28 you know there are some people that
14:30 actually have to contact the different
14:31 societies and publishers and ask them to
14:33 confirm that the metadata is correct and
14:35 then there's people in the online
14:36 department that they make sure that the
14:37 um uh the oracle data warehouse is is
14:41 correctly you know ingesting the data
14:43 and then they do some kind of inspection
14:45 and see if the digital service if the
14:47 streaming services if they provided the
14:49 correct report or if they provided too
14:51 many this missing values and they have
14:52 to go back and forth with the streaming
14:54 service and and tell them you must send
14:56 us a new report you know more complete
14:59 um and then my my job is essentially is
15:01 that i have to um based on uh what the
15:04 customer requests um
15:06 fetch the data in in a given uh time
15:09 point in the pipeline if they want to
15:10 know oh what was the state of the data
15:12 at this time point a
15:13 then i should try to fetch it that way
15:16 um and also too if there's um if they
15:18 receive any kind of discrepancy in the
15:19 reports in terms of how much they're
15:21 being paid we have to try to investigate
15:23 as to why
15:24 uh this occurs and when these type
15:26 investigations happen for instance we
15:28 provide isolate the present state of the
15:30 data
15:32 and then we have to communicate to like
15:33 you know operation uh departments that
15:35 actually deal with the ingestion and the
15:36 day-to-day uh
15:38 work
15:39 and ask them say oh like what happens
15:41 here and then they within their entry
15:42 department you know they try to explain
15:43 it to us and so it's essentially um uh
15:46 we're kind of i guess like the the
15:48 midpoint between you know the internal
15:49 departments that do the data ingestion
15:52 and the customers and you know providing
15:54 the correct reports for them and so uh
15:57 we do various types of reports you know
15:59 um either they would be um just excel
16:01 files that they that they can you know
16:03 look on their computer or we build you
16:05 know custom dashboards for them so that
16:07 and then
16:08 and then provide refreshes so then they
16:10 always have the most up-to-date data
16:14 yeah interesting and
16:16 can you tell us how you got this job so
16:19 you graduated from a bootcamp and then i
16:22 imagine it wasn't easy to get this job
16:24 so how did you do this oh yeah yeah that
16:26 was uh yeah that was quite a journey uh
16:28 so i finished the boot camp i think the
16:30 beginning of august of 2020 and i
16:33 actually didn't get a job offer until
16:35 december of 2020 so about four or four
16:38 and a half months
16:40 you started this uh
16:42 already after the pandemic right
16:45 so i guess you applied to the boot camp
16:48 before the pandemic right and then the
16:50 yeah yes started
16:52 yeah yeah well actually so it wasn't the
16:54 best time i guess for looking for a job
16:56 place yeah yeah i mean
16:58 you know pandemic you know uh coming
17:00 about and making you know the job search
17:01 much easier
17:02 much easier but you know hey uh what you
17:06 know it's life it's the world it happens
17:07 um the the boot camp i think i found out
17:10 about it um sometime around um april
17:14 april of 2020
17:15 and then i and then i finally got the
17:18 funding um and started it may of 2020
17:21 and then and then it finished the
17:22 beginning of august of 2020
17:24 and and then um i had to you know do the
17:27 job hunt sent out like a ton of
17:29 applications with you know getting
17:31 constant feedback on cvs and uh and
17:33 cover letters and stuff like that
17:36 uh and then work five months right it
17:38 took
17:39 yeah yeah
17:42 yeah it was quite some time um and then
17:45 when i talked to like other fellow
17:46 graduates or other people that were also
17:48 like in the same boat as me either doing
17:49 career transitions or trying to find uh
17:51 or break into you know the the domain
17:54 they also they also had quite a bit of a
17:56 hard time you know um applying and
17:58 sending out and doing you know like
18:00 those take-home tests or like those
18:01 take-home challenges and stuff like that
18:05 yeah so how did it go for you so you
18:08 graduated in august and then you found
18:10 the job in december so what did you do
18:14 in these four or five months that
18:16 actually eventually led to the job
18:20 uh oh yeah so um
18:22 uh in parallel to to applying uh for
18:24 with all these jobs you know going on
18:27 linkedin or in google going around and
18:28 stuff like that i also uh uh worked at
18:31 like a i volunteered of forum dinner
18:34 uh doing one of their um
18:36 one of their you know
18:38 eco projects
18:40 and so i chose i chose to do that as
18:42 kind of like a
18:44 kind of a cv filler but also to keep me
18:46 occupied and keep me like on my toes in
18:48 terms of like coding and understanding
18:50 machine learning and all that kind of
18:52 stuff and it was just a good way like to
18:53 also maybe like a proper distraction
18:55 from the worries of always having to
18:58 look for work and stuff
19:00 um and that was also a really good
19:01 experience i i learned a lot from other
19:04 people and you know how they how they
19:05 see coding and like the solutions they
19:07 came up with and like the brainstorming
19:08 and the collaborative collaboration and
19:10 stuff like that uh so yeah that's how i
19:12 also filled up my time during those
19:14 three months
19:15 it's om dana right um yes
19:18 yeah i remember
19:19 you mentioned that when we last time
19:22 when we talked i think it was before you
19:23 found job
19:25 and i remember you were actually asking
19:28 if uh how to figure out if engineering
19:31 if i'm more interested in engineering
19:33 but i think for you you did this
19:35 bootcamp in
19:37 yeah data science
19:37 your last year more interested in
19:39 engineering yeah maybe can you tell us a
19:41 bit more about that so how did you
19:42 realize that in you're more interested
19:44 in engineering rather than science and
19:47 how did you how did this affect your job
19:50 search uh yeah um so i remember at the
19:54 time i i thought it was quite cold you
19:56 know to be able to to build up pipelines
19:58 and or to build platforms or to build uh
20:00 dashboards um and and i also found that
20:03 you know it's not like it in the real
20:06 world it's not like a data science boot
20:07 camp where the the the data is
20:09 served to you in a silver platter and
20:11 all you have to do is just analyze it
20:13 there's actually quite a lot of work
20:14 that goes into it and that typically
20:15 involves you know a little bit more data
20:16 engineering
20:17 um and you know fixing up the data and
20:21 so when i was uh searching for jobs i
20:22 would actually search for both both data
20:24 engineering and uh data analytics and i
20:27 would see you know whichever one uh
20:28 worked out first i i would go for um it
20:31 turns out with this position that i
20:32 eventually got hired for i mean it's it
20:34 is titled uh a data anal a business data
20:37 analyst but honestly i feel like i do
20:39 both both data analytics and data
20:40 engineering because with our team we're
20:43 in the in the process of you know trying
20:44 to automate as many of these customer
20:46 reports as possible so then we could do
20:48 more advanced uh data analytics and like
20:51 predictive modeling and stuff like that
20:53 and so a lot of this you know automation
20:55 and
20:56 automating and you know reducing our
20:58 workload for just like you know instead
20:59 of just being sql monkeys um this uh
21:02 this actually takes quite quite a bit of
21:03 engineering understanding the data
21:05 warehouses understanding how to optimize
21:07 the sql queries um and you know
21:09 integrating um these sql queries into
21:12 like either r or python scripts
21:14 or even using docker to um
21:17 to push it to aws and have it run um you
21:20 know at a fixed frequency
21:25 and you learned all that at ice already
21:27 right or you already knew a bit of that
21:30 i i think you cover you learned a bit of
21:32 docker that's fine
21:35 yeah yeah so i first learned to docker
21:37 at the spice and i and i one of the
21:39 projects that we worked on was a docker
21:41 base you know with the twitter bot and
21:42 stuff like that um but then i didn't
21:44 touch it again you know once uh i i
21:47 finished my time with spice i didn't
21:48 really touch it uh touch on it again and
21:49 then at the end of last year um we've uh
21:52 we found in the team that we could work
21:54 better more collaboratively and much
21:55 easier if we you know uh used um you
21:58 know docker containers
22:00 uh so for instance there was one
22:02 handover project i had from a colleague
22:04 um he wrote all his scripts in r but in
22:06 his local machine um and he had we had
22:08 we had different versions of libraries
22:11 our libraries you know vp tuner machines
22:13 and then when it came to me i had to
22:14 like test the scripts and see if they
22:16 run i couldn't execute any of them just
22:18 because i didn't have the appropriate
22:20 libraries and installations and when i
22:22 tried to figure out like you know which
22:24 ones to do i had to i had to downgrade
22:26 so many uh libraries and they said no
22:28 this is not a proper solution
22:30 so uh we essentially decided to uh to
22:32 rebuild the scripts in docker uh
22:34 containers and images
22:36 to to verify you know that they will
22:38 always work and now this is that's what
22:40 we do with the project um everything um
22:43 anything we want we want to run remotely
22:45 on aws whether it be long scripts or
22:47 automated automated reports we first
22:49 build them in docker and then just push
22:50 them to aws for the for the the
22:53 developer to then start the you know the
22:55 job the frequency
22:57 yeah coming back to your job search do
22:59 you remember how many applications did
23:01 you
23:02 need to send to
23:03 to eventually get the job
23:05 it was painful i had i actually had to
23:07 count at the end of the year i was i
23:09 think i was like around 130.
23:12 130. yeah yeah i yeah i remember i
23:15 counted you how did you keep track like
23:18 did you put this in excel spreadsheet or
23:21 no so uh i i actually eventually i had
23:23 to do that um so but you know for every
23:25 job application i created my own um
23:28 because you have to send your
23:29 application in pdf format and stuff like
23:31 that so i kept you know every job
23:33 description and every application that i
23:35 submitted in pdf on my computer and then
23:37 i think one over the course of like two
23:39 or three days i had to go back to this
23:41 directory in my computer and count
23:43 how many job applications i sent and
23:45 yeah it was one around 130 ish
23:49 why did you
23:50 need to create a folder for each
23:51 application
23:53 oh no no no so i oh um i think uh
23:57 essentially for each application i had
23:58 one pdf which is the java description
24:00 and the second pdf was the the actual
24:02 application that i sent so you know the
24:03 concatenated um cover letter and uh and
24:06 cv and um yeah and whatever you know
24:09 form they wanted me to fill out
24:11 okay so this is you were just
24:14 keeping this for your own
24:16 analysis afterwards yes yes so it was
24:19 just like for my own records um and for
24:20 consistency and in case i need to you
24:22 know reference back to anything it's
24:24 it's right there uh but yeah it's not
24:26 like you know they're all little folders
24:28 on my desktop they're they're sub
24:29 folders you know within a folder
24:35 so was it helpful to keep it organized
24:37 in such a way because usually when
24:40 i look for a job i just
24:43 well last time i wasn't i was a
24:45 selective but
24:46 a few jobs before that
24:48 the strategy i used was spring bridge
24:50 just click as many apply buttons as
24:52 possible without really keeping track of
24:55 where i apply and then i would sometimes
24:57 get invites to
24:59 to talk to a recruiter and then i
25:01 thought okay what is this company doing
25:03 like and then they would ask me
25:04 questions like okay tell you
25:07 and tell us what you know about us and
25:09 then okay what do we know about you
25:12 nothing
25:13 so yeah i was going crazy
25:15 so did you keep track of these things to
25:17 actually you know stay organized and to
25:19 understand where you applied and you
25:21 know keep track of what company is doing
25:24 yeah i i actually did um so for instance
25:27 for applications um i would if i was
25:29 really interested in a job in the job um
25:31 you know job post and i i was fully
25:33 intent on actually applying for it i
25:35 would save you know the job description
25:36 as a pdf because you know as quickly as
25:39 they post the job as quickly you know
25:40 they take them down
25:41 so it was just like a personal record
25:43 and it was also to see like for instance
25:44 if i would go it was it was i was later
25:46 in the interview process and um and then
25:49 they mentioned something about
25:49 requirements like oh we offered these
25:51 benefits and this is our salary range
25:54 and stuff like that i would you know go
25:55 back to the job description to see if oh
25:57 is this still the case or did they
25:59 uh change it quite a bit
26:01 okay uh-huh that's smart
26:03 yeah yeah because you never know that
26:05 that happens as well and then also too i
26:07 i kept like my applications to see okay
26:09 what did i actually say what did i
26:11 actually write you know in my original
26:12 application
26:13 you know in case you know they they they
26:15 mention it again in the interview and
26:17 then yeah it'd be good to be consistent
26:19 with at least in their eyes
26:21 did you also do some sort of um
26:24 you know after you have the interview
26:26 did you keep track of what were the
26:28 questions what you answered on this
26:30 question so it was more lightweight um
26:33 not at first but then i started
26:34 realizing that yeah i i should so i did
26:37 that quite a bit i mean i didn't create
26:38 a spreadsheet for every single interview
26:40 of that what i did was i just created
26:42 like one massive doc of like uh
26:44 questions i felt stood out
26:46 or i felt were either very challenging
26:47 or very good and then i would i would
26:49 write them down and then i would and
26:51 then um i didn't exactly write down like
26:53 what how i actually responded but my
26:55 ideal response would be you know the
26:57 aftermath you know
26:59 whenever you're not nervous or anything
27:00 like that yeah so when you know the
27:03 question and then you come back to this
27:05 question with uh
27:07 with your
27:08 you know when you're not stressed
27:10 you just sit down and
27:12 write your ideal answer and that
27:14 probably helps you get this question or
27:16 similar yeah yeah yeah exactly so so the
27:18 next time because i guess there's only
27:20 so many finite questions uh you know
27:22 companies can ask you um then it's and
27:25 it's also a good way to practice uh for
27:26 instance if i if i had an interview on
27:28 you like that i was coming up i would
27:30 take my long list of
27:32 collection of questions and i would just
27:33 go through them one by one and yeah it
27:35 helped a lot
27:37 by the way do you remember so from this
27:39 130 applications how many
27:42 first interviews do you have
27:44 i have to say i want to say between 10
27:46 and 13.
27:49 so it's like 10
27:50 sort of conversion rate or success rate
27:53 yes
27:55 see
27:57 the what do you think was the most
27:58 difficult thing uh during this process
28:01 for you
28:03 maybe or something else
28:05 i'm sorry
28:06 was it life coding perhaps or maybe
28:08 something else i know many people many
28:10 people it's very difficult to do live
28:12 coding so i'm wondering was it for you
28:16 i mean i only had one one life coding
28:19 session and that one i i thought was was
28:21 quite difficult
28:23 um it's just uh yeah i'm a nervous
28:25 interviewer and i don't do very well
28:27 under pressure especially if someone uh
28:29 is looking at my screen
28:31 and the the thing that sucked about this
28:32 one is that um
28:34 when they uh when they scheduled the
28:35 interview with me they actually didn't
28:36 um explain to me what would occur in the
28:38 interview i thought it would be like a
28:41 multi-interview process where you uh
28:42 where you would first you know meet the
28:44 team or and then possibly meet hr
28:46 afterwards you know and stuff like that
28:48 but they all smushed it into one and
28:49 they surprised me i think like um the
28:51 last half an hour the interview oh by
28:52 the way we're going to be doing a live
28:54 coding challenge
28:55 and i was like oh that's so cheap that's
28:57 so mean
29:00 uh so it's like oh definitely challenge
29:02 uh i mean it didn't
29:04 yeah i know it didn't go very well
29:05 because at the time i was uh i was quite
29:07 bad at python class you know writing a
29:09 class and um
29:11 and i had to do that live and at the
29:12 time um it was very difficult i was not
29:15 able to do it during the the live code
29:17 and also to the
29:19 the data engineer wanted to see like how
29:21 i did googling and and stuff like that
29:22 and yeah it was i was quite nervous for
29:25 that and i think um i want to say 10
29:27 minutes after the interview i i saw i
29:29 was able to write the the whole class
29:31 and then i i sent it to them and said oh
29:32 here just in case you know blah blah
29:34 blah
29:35 uh she wants to want to consider me but
29:37 um but yeah it is so surprising you know
29:39 how long it takes you know for you to do
29:41 some kind of coding when you're under
29:43 pressure online versus like when you're
29:44 just on your own
29:45 figuring stuff out
29:48 so you said you couldn't do this live
29:50 but then after the interview ended you
29:54 um you just did this right because you
29:56 didn't have yeah
29:58 and then you send it to them and then
29:59 what happened after that
30:01 i mean um in the end uh yeah they sent
30:03 me uh like an email like i think like
30:05 one or two weeks later saying oh yeah so
30:07 we were we were uh we we felt so honored
30:09 that we were so many applicants that
30:11 applied and there's so many uh nice
30:13 applicants you know all the the fluffy
30:15 you know uh stuff basically rejection
30:18 yeah yes it says you're just like oh you
30:19 know
30:20 um unfortunately we're not gonna
30:23 continue with your application but if
30:25 you allow us you know because you know
30:26 of the gdpr and the data protection and
30:29 stuff like that we would like to keep
30:30 your um
30:31 uh like your personal data on file um i
30:34 mean at the end i decided uh that no um
30:36 i would actually i'd like to exercise my
30:38 rights to date a privacy and it should i
30:41 want to apply for a new position there
30:43 the you know the ad will drop will pop
30:45 up again and i will just reapply
30:48 okay so you ask them to delete your data
30:51 yes yes okay and then this way you can
30:53 apply again and then they don't know
30:56 well theoretically right if they follow
30:58 the process yeah yeah that is true yeah
31:01 technically if they follow the process
31:02 yeah they wouldn't know but i mean i
31:04 also wonder too you know i mean there's
31:05 all these companies that say oh we would
31:06 like to keep your data just in case of
31:08 anything i mean do companies actually go
31:10 through their their actual you know
31:11 applicants pool
31:13 to look for people yeah so for me i'm
31:15 like you know there's some point in
31:17 approving this and especially i don't
31:19 know especially with you know this day
31:20 and age with like you know all the the
31:22 data privacy problems
31:24 if if i can avoid it you know i would
31:26 rather keep my data to myself
31:29 i think i primed you a little bit when i
31:30 asked what was the most difficult thing
31:32 maybe you were going to
31:34 say something else not life coding i
31:36 actually had i have to give it a good
31:37 thing um i mean i would say
31:39 um there were
31:41 like many difficult things in different
31:43 stages of the whole process at the
31:44 beginning it was writing creating a good
31:47 cv and a cover letter that was hard at
31:49 the beginning but once i got into good
31:51 practice with that it was okay
31:55 then i would say the the next things
31:57 were um
31:59 just um just um oh i i think i would say
32:02 the one thing that was difficult and i
32:04 still have trouble with it's about the
32:05 salary negotiation i i think that that
32:07 is the most difficult because i find
32:09 that that that's a key determinant as to
32:12 whether they even consider you as an
32:13 applicant and how far along you go in
32:14 the application process
32:17 and yeah it's i i really it's a it's
32:19 quite a necessary skill set to have to
32:21 know like you're worth and
32:23 uh to really insist on it
32:26 how do you know that especially if
32:28 you're fresh out of a boot camp
32:31 you haven't
32:32 you do not have such insights into the
32:35 market yeah you know how do you know
32:37 that
32:38 i mean i guess uh when you first when
32:41 you're first started doing the job
32:42 search um and then many companies ask
32:44 you for your asking salary you just have
32:45 to do a lot of googling and research you
32:47 know on um
32:48 like for i think for instance linkedin
32:50 offers some stats as to um especially um
32:52 you know the city that you reside in um
32:55 how much you should be making ideally
32:58 but there's also two it's they're not
32:59 like very clear stats because they don't
33:01 consider very much your experience level
33:03 it's quite ambiguous
33:05 but also to just talking to different
33:07 people um and uh and they did offer
33:09 quite a bit of career coaching at spice
33:11 you know where i did the boot camp and
33:13 that helped a lot with understanding um
33:15 you know uh like what kind of asking
33:17 salary i should have
33:20 yeah well like i'm just wondering if
33:23 this is your first job and you're
33:25 looking just for your
33:26 job would it be a good strategy to say i
33:29 am ready to take whatever salary you
33:32 offer me just hire me or absolutely not
33:35 really
33:37 why not absolutely not because of course
33:39 they're going to uh they're going to
33:41 give you like the the you know the lower
33:43 salary that they can
33:45 um and and of course um yeah companies
33:48 they're going to try to save as much as
33:49 possible um they want to hire the most
33:52 experienced person for the least amount
33:54 of money
33:55 um yeah and and of course uh
33:58 i guess uh um it also
34:00 maybe i've heard that also that um
34:02 if you ask for too low it's a reflection
34:05 of how unconfident you feel so i uh so
34:08 i've heard the the asking salary that
34:09 you have actually is a reflection of how
34:12 confident you feel um of your skills
34:15 so i would say that
34:16 or how well you know the market right so
34:18 maybe you don't yeah yeah that is true
34:20 yeah i mean i think that's a skill set
34:22 in itself knowing the the market well
34:23 enough to ask for salary
34:26 okay yeah that could be tough i imagine
34:28 even for people with experience already
34:31 although with people with experience who
34:32 already have a job they can just okay
34:34 what i'm making now let's add ten
34:36 percent to that and
34:37 yeah yeah a good baseline right but if
34:39 you don't have a job then okay how much
34:42 should i ask
34:43 not to mask too much not to ask too much
34:45 but also not to ask too low
34:47 and for you what it was helpful you said
34:50 you had career a career coach at spice
34:52 who helped you with these numbers right
34:55 yeah yes so having career coach and also
34:57 just having um
34:59 friends or like colleagues from from the
35:01 boot camp that um are more veteran to
35:03 the to industry and knowing how to do
35:05 salary negotiation and know how having
35:07 to do a self-evaluation for um
35:10 for salary negotiation and stuff like
35:12 that so they also i also consulted with
35:13 them a lot and that helped a lot too so
35:15 actually uh networking is quite helpful
35:18 as well
35:19 can you share any tips when it comes to
35:21 salary negotiation something that
35:24 your friends shared with you and was
35:26 what was helpful for you
35:28 um
35:29 i guess uh i'm trying to think i mean
35:31 for uh for the position that i got um i
35:34 think i i in the end i i did ask uh
35:36 slightly below um
35:38 uh the the market a little bit like
35:40 about 5k below by accident um because i
35:43 typically asked around the average
35:44 market but by accident for that
35:45 application i put in a little less
35:47 um and i guess that's why one of the
35:49 reasons why they took me as well
35:51 um i don't know for in in terms of tips
35:53 um i i would say my friends
35:56 and also the career coach they told me
35:57 to always ask for a little more and then
35:59 you negotiate your way quite down or
36:02 also too i also have a friend that told
36:04 me that um she she waited to hear like
36:06 what their um salary offer was and then
36:09 she always added one or two k more and
36:12 she's like they're not going to turn
36:13 down turn down my application just for
36:15 over one or two or two thousand euros
36:19 yeah thanks for sharing the leaps
36:22 so you you started
36:25 you studied data science right but you
36:27 ended up not doing data science was it
36:29 actually useful for you what you learned
36:31 at spiced
36:33 yeah it really was um yeah in terms of
36:35 like for instance programming alone um i
36:38 had never worked with python prior to uh
36:40 to go into spice and of course now i
36:42 work a lot with python and sql as well
36:46 um and just and a lot of the tools uh
36:48 like data engineering tools that i
36:50 learned in um at spice i also use on my
36:52 job as well or what we'll use uh for
36:55 instance uh docker uh now i use that a
36:57 lot
36:58 um and then i also learned a little bit
37:00 about air flow while i was in spice and
37:02 in my and my team they're interested in
37:04 trying to incorporate air flow into the
37:06 into everyday activity so i uh
37:09 yeah even though i i don't do a data
37:11 science at the moment but um there's
37:13 plans for us a couple members in our
37:15 team to start doing more predictive
37:16 modeling so more machine learning um i
37:19 definitely learned a lot of the things i
37:21 learned at spice was very helpful for my
37:23 job
37:25 if let's say you were to
37:28 go back in time
37:30 and look for a job again
37:32 but with remembering all the experience
37:36 that you have right now what would you
37:38 do what do you what would you have
37:42 what would you do differently now
37:45 um i would say
37:48 definitely
37:49 i guess i could consult a little earlier
37:51 in terms of uh and get get career
37:53 coaching a little earlier and in the
37:54 game i remember i did apply to a couple
37:56 of jobs and had one or two interviews
37:58 prior to attending the boot camp at
38:00 spiced and prior to getting through
38:02 career coaching and i
38:03 retrospectively looking back i see i
38:05 made a ton of mistakes
38:07 when i was doing that interview um
38:09 definitely
38:10 about us salary expectations i would uh
38:13 yeah
38:14 definitely do that um much better
38:17 let's see what else um
38:20 i mean in the end you know there's only
38:22 there's not we can't control everything
38:24 we just and also to the markets are
38:26 changing forever um but also to
38:28 definitely do like even even more
38:30 networking even though during the
38:31 pandemic it's quite difficult you know
38:33 to do a lot of networking everything was
38:35 remote so you only met people you know
38:37 video uh via video or chat or something
38:41 i don't know maybe uh to do the career
38:43 transition either
38:44 earlier even earlier you know back in
38:46 like 2015 or something like that when
38:48 you when you yourself did it
38:50 it must have been very different back
38:52 then
38:53 oh it was different like i had just one
38:54 interview and after that they hired me
38:59 like it's complete opposite of the
39:01 experience you had yeah i was
39:04 so i literally had just one interview
39:06 and that was it like it wasn't even a
39:08 series of interviews like right now
39:09 companies torture applicants through
39:11 like four or five interviews but for me
39:13 just it was just one so first
39:17 the future team lead reached out to me
39:19 on linkedin
39:20 we had a short call then i
39:22 went to the office on the next day and
39:24 then a couple of days after that
39:27 they gave me an offer
39:29 oh nice
39:30 yeah i don't think my experience of
39:32 career transitioning is
39:35 still valid i don't think this works
39:37 differently anymore
39:39 yeah i think uh yeah it's quite
39:40 different now
39:42 yeah
39:43 so that's why as i said at the beginning
39:47 when people invite me to talk about
39:50 career transitioning i usually say yeah
39:52 you know like things were differently
39:55 different back then that's why i really
39:57 like inviting people who did the career
39:59 position transition recently so they
40:01 have more fresh perspective on things
40:04 because now it's more difficult right so
40:06 there are now all these bootcamps the
40:08 demand is uh maybe higher but also
40:11 there are more people on the market so
40:13 it's it's very difficult
40:16 i mean uh have you uh have you
40:17 interviewed people um that had the
40:19 transition even more recently within the
40:21 past year or six months
40:24 no maybe not
40:26 i mean i wonder what it is now you know
40:28 like well it's how is it now is it even
40:30 worse or is it even
40:32 or maybe maybe it should but still for
40:35 you it took like five months i think
40:37 this is a pretty long time and it was
40:39 difficult yeah yeah um
40:41 so
40:42 i hope it's easier now
40:47 okay and
40:48 yeah you said you did a ton of mistakes
40:50 and then you needed to talk to career
40:53 coaches who pointed out to these
40:55 mistakes one of them were salary
40:57 negotiations
40:58 do you remember what kind of other
41:00 mistakes you did
41:02 other mistakes
41:04 um
41:07 um
41:08 i'm trying to think maybe it's uh
41:09 something i i said incorrectly in an
41:11 interview so like they were expecting
41:13 one answer and and i gave them another
41:16 um i think also too sometimes oh a
41:19 couple of uh i guess you know like tech
41:21 challenges that i did uh for one another
41:24 for another data engineering position um
41:27 i think they they didn't like i guess
41:28 like some of the the techniques that i
41:30 use in in my code and they felt like oh
41:32 it was essentially the like the same the
41:34 same thing um over and over again
41:37 um and then i uh i felt like in the
41:40 instructions when they gave me the like
41:42 the the take-home challenge uh they were
41:44 quite ambiguous and and then they in the
41:46 email exchange they made a lot of
41:47 references like oh but we had stated
41:48 this we had stated that and i felt like
41:51 the um the communication uh the way the
41:53 um the hiring manager like how he was
41:55 communicating what they wanted wasn't
41:57 very clear so i guess that registered to
41:59 look back i would i would say i would
42:01 have spoken out and said no um this is
42:03 not what you should uh what you said
42:05 this this is not how i interpreted it um
42:08 of course at the time you know you're a
42:09 little nervous and you're a little too
42:11 humble so you tend to stay quiet but
42:12 like looking back now you know i feel
42:14 like i have a little more power because
42:16 i have a job and stuff i'm like no
42:17 that's not what you said so i can you
42:19 know stand up for myself and stuff like
42:21 that
42:22 yeah interesting thanks for sharing that
42:25 we i see that we have some questions
42:28 so one of the questions is from vadim is
42:31 what are the top skills or tech stack
42:34 that you believe helped you to get this
42:36 role
42:38 um definitely uh knowing a bit of um
42:41 programming so so both python and r um
42:44 and um i did put that i knew sql even
42:46 though i had only done it for i think
42:47 like two weeks in the boot camp um they
42:50 they liked a lot that i went to a boot
42:51 camp so i had experience with using
42:53 machine learning and stuff like that so
42:55 they definitely hired me for that um i
42:57 felt like uh one thing that they really
42:58 liked about me in the interview was um
43:01 how i recognized the the importance of
43:03 clean data of doing
43:05 data quality checks
43:07 because you know
43:08 if you don't check
43:09 your data and whether it's clean or not
43:11 it really skews your your results and
43:13 your and your reports and you know it
43:15 and i see it from the day-to-day work
43:16 that it's really necessary for us to do
43:18 that so i think that was the one of the
43:19 things that that stood out
43:22 can you tell us a bit more about this
43:25 checks uh checking for data quality was
43:28 it like a
43:29 to take home test and then you did like
43:32 you went an extra
43:33 the extra mile and added some checks or
43:36 how do
43:37 but for this particular position um it
43:39 was just a sql challenges where they
43:41 gave um where they hired another company
43:43 to to provide me with an sql test like a
43:46 live sql session i mean i had i think
43:48 like an hour to answer uh three or four
43:51 sql challenges
43:53 um but actually this data cleaning thing
43:55 it came more in the interview in the
43:56 interview process um i i think i'm in in
43:58 terms of skills you know everyone they
44:00 go to boot camps now or do these online
44:02 courses and they essentially have you
44:03 know the kind of i guess the kind of the
44:04 same skill sets i guess what they look
44:06 for in interviews what stands out it's
44:08 like if the person recognizes you know
44:09 what it's essential in the on the on the
44:11 job because you know a lot of companies
44:13 think and it is kind of true that you
44:15 know
44:16 you can learn things on the job whatever
44:17 skills you're missing technical skills
44:19 you're missing you can learn it on the
44:20 job but i guess like uh like for
44:22 instance like if you know how to provide
44:24 insights if you know how to detect
44:25 anomalies and if you know um how to work
44:28 what to do um when you know data is just
44:31 uh not clean and not organized you need
44:33 to do quite a bit of um you know fixing
44:36 it up and uh like what steps do you take
44:38 and stuff like that i would say maybe
44:40 they consider this a little more
44:41 important
44:43 and you did learn quite a few things on
44:46 the job right things that you didn't
44:47 know about or maybe you just work with
44:49 them a little bit lexico you said you
44:51 spent only two weeks learning sql but
44:53 now it's pretty much
44:55 uh all
44:56 that you do all day right well maybe not
44:58 that but like 50 at least
45:00 um so you definitely can learn all that
45:03 yeah yeah yeah exactly i mean i didn't
45:05 know this before i started uh working on
45:07 my job but there's different flavors of
45:09 sql you know each data warehouse has
45:11 their own
45:12 uh their own format of sql so for
45:14 instance like one sql query that i will
45:16 execute in in one data warehouse like
45:17 for example redshift sometimes won't
45:20 work in an oracle-based data warehouse
45:22 i'll have to customize
45:23 the the queries in that way
45:25 so yes it's just learning to recognize
45:27 that
45:29 and another question from bala is which
45:32 cloud platform did you learn
45:36 oh cloud
45:38 did you learn any cloud platform
45:40 at bootcamp
45:41 yeah yeah so at spice we did aws just
45:45 because um it's it's free for the first
45:47 year i mean it's even it's actually
45:49 quite cheap to um to continue learning
45:51 even after the first year is done um i
45:54 did a little bit of google cloud
45:56 platform but but not as much
45:59 it was but i think um in terms of like
46:01 cloud platforms aws is like the most
46:03 requested
46:05 and uh when you learned google cloud
46:07 platform was it already after the
46:09 bootcamp
46:10 yeah it was um i was exploring i was
46:13 actually exploring how to um um how to
46:16 uh do um i think some kind of dashboards
46:19 uh in our at the time and so i think uh
46:21 there's this one medium article i found
46:23 that how it was possible on google cloud
46:25 platform so for one weekend i just sat
46:27 down and gave it a go over there
46:31 a good thing about google cloud platform
46:33 is when you sign up you get three
46:35 hundred dollars and you can do pretty
46:36 much everything with these three hundred
46:38 dollars while in aws
46:41 there are only some services that
46:43 you can use under this street here so in
46:46 google cloud platform you have more
46:47 freedom but it's also only for three
46:49 months
46:50 so yeah yeah
46:53 yeah but i also actually i also remember
46:55 from google cloud platform when i was uh
46:57 trying out some stuff um
46:59 those credits actually went by quite
47:00 fast if you don't know what you're doing
47:01 and if you let things run
47:03 um like all night or yeah you don't pay
47:05 attention to what you're executing those
47:08 credits can go by pretty fast well at
47:10 least it's not here 300 dollars yeah
47:12 that's true
47:13 that's that's good and then
47:16 in the worst case if 300 dollars are
47:20 gone is gone then you can just you know
47:21 create maybe a new account
47:24 if you have your three hundred dollars
47:26 and the aircon
47:27 then
47:28 yeah you don't have them anywhere
47:31 quite painful
47:32 yeah okay okay
47:35 so let's say you
47:36 again needed to go through the same
47:39 career transitioning so you work in
47:41 academia doing research your contract is
47:44 over and you want to go to programming
47:47 would you again go through a data
47:50 science bootcamp or you would have done
47:52 things differently
47:54 i mean in my personal opinion what i
47:56 remember when i was uh looking for jobs
47:58 in the job market um a lot of companies
47:59 they equated like online courses and the
48:02 data science bootcamp has the same like
48:04 they actually didn't really see a
48:05 difference
48:07 um i personally think i preferred um the
48:09 data science boot camp and and i would
48:10 do it again um just because um i had a
48:13 teacher to talk to um uh like a couple
48:16 different teachers to talk to and you
48:17 know um and customized projects and just
48:20 interacting and working with um other
48:22 other students
48:24 um i mean i think this is invaluable um
48:27 i i would definitely do it again
48:30 would you maybe consider doing a data
48:32 engineering bootcamp i think there are
48:34 in berlin there is at least one maybe
48:36 two not as many as data science
48:38 bootcamps but there are data engineering
48:40 bootcamps as well would you maybe now
48:42 consider doing this kind of bootcamp or
48:44 you would still go with the data science
48:46 one i mean that's hard to say um because
48:49 at the time i think when i was doing the
48:51 data science bootcamp they try to fit a
48:52 little bit of everything a little bit of
48:53 data analytics data engineering and data
48:56 science of course
48:57 it sounded like that when you described
48:59 that so you were doing docker you were
49:00 doing machine learning you were doing
49:02 uh airflow there
49:04 it's uh actually a little but data
49:06 science is also a little bit of
49:08 everything i'd say you need to be
49:10 good at
49:11 you know you need to know
49:13 to some extent a lot of things yeah yeah
49:17 i mean i i think it would depend on the
49:18 person if if you were a person that
49:20 i mean at the time for me i think it was
49:22 good uh because um i wasn't sure like
49:24 what part of the data science fields i
49:26 want to get into whether it be analytics
49:28 predictive modeling or engineering
49:30 um so it was good to go to boot camp
49:32 that had a little bit of everything um
49:33 but i guess if you're a person that
49:34 knows your debt setup like oh i
49:36 definitely want to do any of this i
49:37 definitely want to do data engineering
49:38 then i guess those boot camps
49:40 would be great for you so i guess they
49:41 kind of like you know
49:43 serve your niche a little more
49:47 yes not everyone has this luxury of
49:49 knowing what exactly they want to do
49:51 after academia right so in academia
49:56 you you understood that you want to do
49:58 coding but what exactly what does it
50:00 mean to the coding right
50:01 yeah yeah exactly yeah i mean even
50:03 though i knew i didn't want to work in
50:04 academia anymore and i wanted to do more
50:06 i guess like analytics and code
50:08 eccentric things but i also wasn't 100
50:11 sure exactly what i wanted to do
50:14 yeah maybe can you tell us a bit about
50:17 the projects you did at spice what kind
50:19 of uh like at the end i know that you
50:21 have some individual projects when you
50:23 needed to work
50:24 yourself on some things i think you did
50:26 something related to twitter analytics
50:28 right
50:29 uh yeah um so it was essentially
50:31 learning how to build um um a data
50:34 pipeline using docker to fetch data from
50:37 a twitter api based on whatever or
50:40 whatever hashtags you're interested in
50:41 or parameters
50:43 and then um and and then program and
50:45 then uh coding uh that a tweet um you
50:48 know like one of those um those bots on
50:50 slack would uh would provide you with
50:52 the tweet information like once every
50:54 hour or once every minute or something
50:55 like that
50:57 was it actually a project that you
50:59 needed to do yourself your individual
51:01 project or something that everyone
51:03 needed to do it was one that everyone
51:05 did so they they cut they um they you
51:07 know outlined the project and they
51:08 custom built it and then they provided
51:10 us with uh with lessons every day on how
51:12 to do a different part of the project
51:13 until we you know we delivered it on
51:15 friday
51:16 so it took one week to build this
51:18 pipeline was it
51:20 the lesson about building pipelines you
51:22 said
51:23 yeah yeah so it was essentially like
51:25 learning to you know to build a docker
51:27 containers uh you know for one one to
51:30 just collect the tweets a second one to
51:32 um to clean them up and then a third one
51:35 uh to push um the tweet information to
51:38 to slack every hour
51:41 i'm wondering so now so let's say
51:44 somebody graduates from bootcamp at data
51:46 talks club will also
51:48 call them zoom but they're similar like
51:50 workshops
51:52 so people finish these courses with a
51:54 bunch of projects that they did
51:58 on the course and also individually as
52:00 as a part of the course but how to
52:02 actually sell quote unquote this to
52:06 future
52:07 to future employees like how do you say
52:09 that okay this is the thing i did
52:12 and i am valuable because i know how to
52:14 do these things so how how to actually
52:17 show that uh you can do these things
52:19 using these projects
52:21 do they even believe you that
52:24 because if you do this as a part of your
52:26 the course right so maybe you just
52:27 follow the instructor and that's all
52:31 yeah yes i mean it is quite tricky i
52:33 mean um they they always tell you oh you
52:35 have to build a um you know getting a
52:37 portfolio full of projects you know to
52:39 show uh to show at your job application
52:41 but then also too when they see these
52:43 projects are basically from like you
52:45 know boot camp or from an online course
52:47 and then probably they see the same
52:48 projects over and over again
52:50 i guess you know they do get quite tired
52:52 of it i would say maybe the um
52:53 individualized the personal projects
52:56 would be uh would be better uh if or if
52:58 you like you know custom made a project
53:00 yourself um and you show you know what
53:02 why did you um start the project like
53:04 why did you choose that topic like why
53:05 are you interested in doing this
53:06 particular project i think this stands
53:08 out a little more um i mean uh for one
53:10 of the the data engineering jobs i
53:12 applied for i mean i didn't get it in
53:14 the end but one of the reasons why they
53:16 um they chose my application to go for
53:18 continuing in the application process
53:20 was is because they found that um the
53:22 individual project at the end of the
53:23 bootcamp that i did something on
53:24 sustainability they thought that was
53:26 interesting
53:27 and they saw that i was like interested
53:28 in sustainability so that's why they
53:31 they chose me for the application
53:32 process
53:33 what was the project about can you tell
53:35 us
53:36 about it uh it was essentially where i
53:37 was trying to build a data pipeline
53:39 where i would um fetch tweets that had
53:42 uh that had uh were associated with
53:44 sustainability hashtags
53:45 and then i would clean up the data and
53:47 then i would try um and then i was in on
53:49 the like in the process of trying to
53:51 build the dashboards like to show
53:52 different stats and like different um
53:54 uh different features and like different
53:56 insights um about the about the tweets
53:59 that that were being tweeted at the time
54:01 um i mean one of the things one of the
54:03 the things i never got to pick up again
54:04 or i just haven't taken the time to to
54:06 finish it up but i found that there's
54:08 actually quite a bit of a tweet bots on
54:10 data that and that you know that that
54:13 really skews um oh or for instance i did
54:15 a little bit of sentimental analysis on
54:17 the tweets and um tweetbots they skewed
54:20 the sentiment analysis very much
54:22 so um yeah that's another lesson learned
54:25 you like you need to implement ways to
54:27 clean this uh uh you know this activity
54:29 out so you don't get them in your final
54:31 results
54:32 probably there are not so many of them
54:34 like maybe a handful
54:36 that are most active that uh
54:38 you can maybe just remove all them from
54:40 the analysis
54:41 oh yeah this is my experience with
54:43 twitter bots like they're just a few
54:45 that are most annoying the most visible
54:48 ones
54:50 yeah but i think that the problem is
54:52 like and just knowing to identify them
54:53 especially if you just have like tons
54:54 and tons of data in your in your mongodb
54:57 right you you don't know which of them
55:00 exactly yeah it's very difficult to tell
55:02 so i mean there i know there are
55:03 algorithms out there that already can um
55:05 you can implement in your pipeline that
55:07 will auto detect you know you can put a
55:09 that will help you flag you know which
55:11 ones are actually tweet bots uh but
55:13 these are based on um i know one an
55:15 academic research job in the states you
55:16 know they consistently um develop this
55:18 algorithm to be able to determine the
55:20 two bots and they do twitter analysis
55:22 themselves
55:24 for social sciences
55:26 so why this company was interested in
55:28 that is it something they do also as a
55:30 company
55:31 uh no it was just like because my um uh
55:34 my uh the title of my project was i
55:36 guess the current opinion on
55:37 sustainability
55:39 um and i guess it just i'm not sure if
55:41 they actually dug into my my project i
55:43 mean in the interview process they
55:45 didn't ask me like too many uh detailed
55:47 questions about it they just asked
55:49 they just asked me like oh give like a
55:50 brief summary on on this project and
55:52 that was it i think they were more
55:53 interested and like uh that oh i was
55:56 also interested in you know their
55:57 mission because they were a
55:58 sustainability company
56:00 so that i was also like a person that
56:02 took a personal interest in that topic
56:05 yeah i heard a different a similar story
56:08 a little bit different about also like
56:10 personal interest so one person got a
56:12 job interview because they mentioned
56:15 meditation as the interest and that
56:17 person who was doing screening was also
56:19 into meditation so that's why
56:22 they invited that person and they talked
56:25 a bit about that at the beginning so you
56:27 never know what will work out at the end
56:29 yeah yeah that's okay sustainability
56:31 could be your interest in meditation
56:33 could be anything
56:35 but
56:36 i guess this is um not easy to
56:39 like when you have a pile of
56:40 applications like how do you select who
56:42 to interview right
56:45 yeah that that is very true
56:48 okay yeah we have another question from
56:50 chris
56:52 so chris is asking what was your cohort
56:54 like at spiced were they all similar at
56:58 similar career stages as you people with
57:00 phd masters etc
57:02 or they had different background
57:05 oh we all had a different background but
57:07 it was also quite nice they were also in
57:09 there like uh in their transition phases
57:11 of their lives so even though we came
57:13 from different backgrounds we related to
57:14 each other so much and we actually
57:16 exchanged a lot of our personal you know
57:18 career stories
57:20 but there were one there were a couple
57:21 project former project managers um there
57:23 were uh two um two people that are on
57:25 the verge of finishing their their phds
57:28 um there were others that that used to
57:29 work in consulting um
57:32 like from for many different domains
57:35 yeah so it i mean there's i've heard
57:36 that there are some cohorts where they
57:38 have a like um either more or less
57:40 diversity in terms of you know different
57:42 backgrounds i know i think that either
57:44 the cohort before or two cohorts before
57:47 me they were mostly you know um
57:48 academics trying to um get into machine
57:51 learning and stuff like that
57:53 um yeah
57:54 very
57:55 cohort is different
57:57 which background was the most
57:59 interesting to you
58:00 do you maybe remember
58:03 i think i i felt like the one that um
58:06 that was quite like yeah um a transition
58:09 or a difference was uh the um my one of
58:12 my colleagues uh he has a background in
58:14 literature and was doing his phd um in
58:17 yeah in the classics but uh he wanted to
58:20 get into data engineering and coding and
58:22 i i thought i felt like that was a huge
58:24 jump yeah yeah yeah but he was like he
58:26 was super good any time i had i there
58:28 was a bug i couldn't solve i always go
58:29 to him and say oh can you please help me
58:30 out yeah i got this bug and he's like oh
58:32 yeah here let me take care of it for you
58:35 cool
58:36 yeah a couple of um episodes ago i
58:39 invited
58:40 jessica
58:42 and
58:43 she was doing
58:45 she was working as a barista
58:47 and went to
58:48 you know coding that's also quite an
58:50 interesting change from barista to
58:52 coding yeah yeah
58:54 okay i think that's uh
58:56 we should be wrapping up do you want to
58:58 say anything before we finish today
59:02 uh no i mean i think your questions
59:04 essentially covered all of them i'm yeah
59:06 and i mean it was really cool doing this
59:07 um the first time in a long time that
59:09 i've been asked about like you know this
59:11 whole trans transition phase in my life
59:12 it was it was nice you know reminiscing
59:14 about all these things
59:16 i think one year or maybe one year is a
59:18 bit too long
59:20 like six months one year after somebody
59:23 like already got a job i think this is a
59:25 good time to ask how they did the
59:26 transition
59:28 not that i waited on purpose for one
59:31 year before contacting you
59:33 but then i realized okay maybe i should
59:34 talk to gloria and ask about that
59:38 okay yeah thanks a lot for joining us
59:39 today for sharing your experience uh
59:41 for talking about all the difficulties
59:43 you had in your
59:45 job search process thanks also everyone
59:47 for attending today for asking questions
59:51 and i think that would be it for today
59:53 thanks again
59:54 thanks so much
59:55 how are you today
