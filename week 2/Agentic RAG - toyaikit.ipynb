Here’s a general guide based on those insights:\\n\\n### Running Kafka\\n\\n1. **Set Up Environment:**\\n   - Ensure you have Java installed, as Kafka is a Java application. Use Java 8 or above.\\n\\n2. **Download Kafka:**\\n   - Download the latest Kafka binaries from the [Apache Kafka website](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads).\\n\\n3. **Start Kafka and Zookeeper:**\\n   - Kafka requires Zookeeper. If you installed Kafka, it usually comes with Zookeeper.\\n   - Navigate to the Kafka installation directory in your terminal and run the following commands:\\n\\n     ```bash\\n     # Start Zookeeper\\n     bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties\\n\\n     # In a new terminal, start Kafka\\n     bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties\\n     ```\\n\\n   - For Windows users, substitute the `.sh` commands with `.bat`.\\n\\n4. **Create a Topic:**\\n   - After starting Kafka, create a new topic to send messages to:\\n\\n     ```bash\\n     bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1\\n     ```\\n\\n5. **Run Producer and Consumer:**\\n   - Open two new terminal windows.\\n   - In one, run the Kafka producer:\\n\\n     ```bash\\n     bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092\\n     ```\\n\\n   - In the other, run the Kafka consumer to check messages:\\n\\n     ```bash\\n     bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic my-topic --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092\\n     ```\\n\\n6. **Stop the Servers:**\\n   - Use `Ctrl+C` in each terminal to stop the Kafka and Zookeeper servers when you’re done.\\n\\nIf you encounter issues, checking that the Docker containers for Kafka and Zookeeper are running might be necessary (if you are using Docker). You can use the command `docker ps` to confirm if they are active.\\n\\nFeel free to ask if you have more specific requirements or encounter any issues while setting this up!', type='output_text', logprobs=[])], role='assistant', status='completed', type='message'), {'role': 'user', 'content': 'how do i do well in module 1'}, ResponseFunctionToolCall(arguments='{\"query\":\"do well in module 1\"}', call_id='call_WluixvGXtMBJlh90O0JdLSLC', name='search', type='function_call', id='fc_069b00a90a1648c20068f7f1395f34819a9e9ce12f2a2d92eb', status='completed'), {'type': 'function_call_output', 'call_id': 'call_WluixvGXtMBJlh90O0JdLSLC', 'output': '[\\n  {\\n    \"text\": \"Even after installing pyspark correctly on linux machine (VM ) as per course instructions, faced a module not found error in jupyter notebook .\\\\nThe solution which worked for me(use following in jupyter notebook) :\\\\n!pip install findspark\\\\nimport findspark\\\\nfindspark.init()\\\\nThereafter , import pyspark and create spark contex<<t as usual\\\\nNone of the solutions above worked for me till I ran !pip3 install pyspark instead !pip install pyspark.\\\\nFilter based on conditions based on multiple columns\\\\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col\\\\nnew_final.filter((new_final.a_zone==\\\\\"Murray Hill\\\\\") & (new_final.b_zone==\\\\\"Midwood\\\\\")).show()\\\\nKrishna Anand\",\\n    \"section\": \"Module 5: pyspark\",\\n    \"question\": \"Module Not Found Error in Jupyter Notebook .\",\\n    \"course\": \"data-engineering-zoomcamp\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"text\": \"You need to look for the Py4J file and note the version of the filename.

Here’s a general guide based on those insights:\\n\\n### Running Kafka\\n\\n1. **Set Up Environment:**\\n   - Ensure you have Java installed, as Kafka is a Java application. Use Java 8 or above.\\n\\n2. **Download Kafka:**\\n   - Download the latest Kafka binaries from the [Apache Kafka website](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads).\\n\\n3. **Start Kafka and Zookeeper:**\\n   - Kafka requires Zookeeper. If you installed Kafka, it usually comes with Zookeeper.\\n   - Navigate to the Kafka installation directory in your terminal and run the following commands:\\n\\n     ```bash\\n     # Start Zookeeper\\n     bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties\\n\\n     # In a new terminal, start Kafka\\n     bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties\\n     ```\\n\\n   - For Windows users, substitute the `.sh` commands with `.bat`.\\n\\n4. **Create a Topic:**\\n   - After starting Kafka, create a new topic to send messages to:\\n\\n     ```bash\\n     bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1\\n     ```\\n\\n5. **Run Producer and Consumer:**\\n   - Open two new terminal windows.\\n   - In one, run the Kafka producer:\\n\\n     ```bash\\n     bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092\\n     ```\\n\\n   - In the other, run the Kafka consumer to check messages:\\n\\n     ```bash\\n     bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic my-topic --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092\\n     ```\\n\\n6. **Stop the Servers:**\\n   - Use `Ctrl+C` in each terminal to stop the Kafka and Zookeeper servers when you’re done.\\n\\nIf you encounter issues, checking that the Docker containers for Kafka and Zookeeper are running might be necessary (if you are using Docker). You can use the command `docker ps` to confirm if they are active.\\n\\nFeel free to ask if you have more specific requirements or encounter any issues while setting this up!', type='output_text', logprobs=[])], role='assistant', status='completed', type='message'), {'role': 'user', 'content': 'how do i do well in module 1'}, ResponseFunctionToolCall(arguments='{\"query\":\"do well in module 1\"}', call_id='call_WluixvGXtMBJlh90O0JdLSLC', name='search', type='function_call', id='fc_069b00a90a1648c20068f7f1395f34819a9e9ce12f2a2d92eb', status='completed'), {'type': 'function_call_output', 'call_id': 'call_WluixvGXtMBJlh90O0JdLSLC', 'output': '[\\n  {\\n    \"text\": \"Even after installing pyspark correctly on linux machine (VM ) as per course instructions, faced a module not found error in jupyter notebook .\\\\nThe solution which worked for me(use following in jupyter notebook) :\\\\n!pip install findspark\\\\nimport findspark\\\\nfindspark.init()\\\\nThereafter , import pyspark and create spark contex<<t as usual\\\\nNone of the solutions above worked for me till I ran !pip3 install pyspark instead !pip install pyspark.\\\\nFilter based on conditions based on multiple columns\\\\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col\\\\nnew_final.filter((new_final.a_zone==\\\\\"Murray Hill\\\\\") & (new_final.b_zone==\\\\\"Midwood\\\\\")).show()\\\\nKrishna Anand\",\\n    \"section\": \"Module 5: pyspark\",\\n    \"question\": \"Module Not Found Error in Jupyter Notebook .\",\\n    \"course\": \"data-engineering-zoomcamp\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"text\": \"You need to look for the Py4J file and note the version of the filename.
