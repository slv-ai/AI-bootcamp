So I hope\\n0:10 everything um goes smoothly\\n0:13 and this is the first event but not the\\n0:16 last one. We already have uh a few\\n0:18 events planned. So the first one, this\\n0:20 one is about deploying models with\\n0:22 SageMaker. But u we want to meet every\\n0:26 Tuesday\\n0:27 at u 5:00 p.m. uh European time to talk\\n0:31 about different uh technical topics. So\\n0:33 the next week we will have a topic about\\n0:35 customer segmentation. Then we will have\\n0:37 a topic about uh fighting uh fraud uh\\n0:41 with triplet loss about neural nets and\\n0:43 then um slightly different topic more on\\n0:46 the soft side of skills about\\n0:49 communication skills for um data\\n0:52 scientists and other data professionals.\\n0:56 In addition to that, we also want to\\n0:57 have something uh like a lighter format\\n1:00 without slides, just u QA Q&A um just a\\n1:04 conversation that we want to also put as\\n1:07 a podcast later. Um so we haven't\\n1:11 officially planned one yet but the first\\n1:14 we want to run uh next week on Friday\\n1:17 and we'll talk about roles in a data\\n1:20 team\\n1:22 and um yeah so you if you want to if you\\n1:26 found this uh event elsewhere like on\\n1:29 LinkedIn or somewhere else but you\\n1:31 haven't joined the community yet so this\\n1:33 is the link you can use for joining it's\\n1:35 a slack community\\n1:37 so it's very simple just join join data\\n1:40 talks.cl up and this is this will give\\n1:43 you directly an invite invite link to\\n1:46 Slack\\n1:47 and then finally for today we will use\\n1:49 slider for questions.\\n1:52 Uh let me actually uh just put this to\\n1:55 chat\\n1:57 and if you have any questions during the\\n1:59 presentation just use slider to put your\\n2:01 question there and if you see a question\\n2:04 somebody\\n2:06 asked already a question you wanted to\\n2:07 ask just up it.

So first of all I would\\n3:42 like you once I would like once again to\\n3:45 uh say thank you that uh you have come\\n3:48 and uh like for for showing the interest\\n3:51 in the topic and in the community\\n3:53 itself.

Uh so um to have the\\n4:35 better hearing uh device and also like\\n4:38 uh to to be able to identify um these\\n4:42 people yeah who have this uh hearing\\n4:44 loss. Yeah. So uh why I have selected\\n4:49 this topic? So basically uh in Odena we\\n4:52 have the data platform which was hosted\\n4:56 uh which is hosted on AWS. So we have um\\n5:01 a lot of resources there. So when our uh\\n5:03 database is hosted there so our other\\n5:06 resources hosted there and basically all\\n5:07 our stack for the uh data science is\\n5:10 also uh based there.

So uh every estimator in\\n8:17 SageMaker even it's um basically uh\\n8:21 official and um um designed by AWS such\\n8:26 as lineer learner org boost um or custom\\n8:31 estimators they are all having the same\\n8:34 structure. So basically each estimator\\n8:36 in Sage Maker this is the dockerized uh\\n8:40 web service. Yeah. So docerized web\\n8:43 service and um basically this web\\n8:46 service provides the rest API\\n8:49 infrastructure and uh you can think of\\n8:52 it as a a combination of uh training and\\n8:57 uh predict scripts.

       "6:27 the docker itself. So what it is in a\n",
       "6:31 quick words. So how um how men um can\n",
       "6:35 use that and u um so how you can use\n",
       "6:39 that also in the uh AWS hagemaker\n",
       "6:42 um infrastructure. Then we basically\n",
       "6:44 talk we'll talk about the um ML model\n",
       "6:48 structure. So and how basically we can\n",
       "6:50 combine the uh docker itself with the ML\n",
       "6:54 model structure. We talk a bit about um\n",
       "6:57 basically flask application and rest uh\n",
       "7:01 API services that we can basically use\n",
       "7:04 for u building our web models. Uh then\n",
       "7:08 afterwards we will talk a bit about the\n",
       "7:11 execution stack. So how exactly\n",
       "7:14 SageMaker will execute your docker\n",
       "7:16 container with your code. Then a couple\n",

       "7:25 the interface that will help us uh in\n",
       "7:28 our application to connect our server\n",
       "7:31 side and our model site. So um then a\n",
       "7:36 couple of words about the structure of\n",
       "7:38 this repositories about the main\n",
       "7:40 components and the structure of our uh\n",
       "7:43 container application of our code. Um\n",
       "7:45 basically yeah so um let's start\n",
       "7:51 um let's start with the introduc\n",
       "7:53 introduction of uh AWS SageMaker uh\n",
       "7:56 estimator itself. So uh basically to use\n",
       "8:01 uh AWS uh SageMaker uh estimator you\n",
       "8:05 need to understand that uh basically\n",
       "8:07 this is they use the different approach\n",
       "8:09 for example that skyit learn using yeah\n",
       "8:11 or some other um well-known data science\n",
       "8:14 library. So uh every estimator in\n",
       "8:17 SageMaker even it's um basically uh\n",
       "8:21 official and um um designed by AWS such\n",
       "8:26 as lineer learner org boost um or custom\n",
       "8:31 estimators they are all having the same\n",
       "8:34 structure. So basically each estimator\n",
       "8:36 in Sage Maker this is the dockerized uh\n",
       "8:40 web service. Yeah. So docerized web\n",
       "8:43 service and um basically this web\n",
       "8:46 service provides the rest API\n",
       "8:49 infrastructure and uh you can think of\n",
       "8:52 it as a a combination of uh training and\n",
       "8:57 uh predict scripts. Yeah. Which uh uh\n",
       "9:01 wrapped up in the uh flask application\n",
       "9:04 that is providing this recipe uh\n",
       "9:07 infrastructure.\n",
       "9:09 Um so basically if you uh for some\n",
       "9:13 reason uh would like to use your custom\n",
       "9:17 estimators\n",
       "9:18 um you should be able to know the\n",
       "9:20 structure of how to uh organize this\n",
       "9:23 estimator and how to combine them and\n",
       "9:25 how to orchestrate it with the docker.\n",
       "9:28 Yeah. So therefore for us for example in\n",
       "9:32 audibin it's very important uh because\n",
       "9:33 we have a variety of tasks that we need\n",
       "9:36 to combine the certain algorithms for\n",
       "9:40 example we need to do um not uh uh not\n",
       "9:45 just using for example HG boost for uh\n",
       "9:48 classification but for example combine\n",
       "9:50 the different uh ensembles doing some uh\n",
       "9:53 stacking procedure or uh voting\n",
       "9:56 procedure both for classification or\n",
       "9:58 regression. Therefore, um it's not um\n",
       "10:01 allowed yet. Maybe that would be that\n",
       "10:05 will be the support uh later on in Sage\n",
       "10:08 Maker about that. Uh but right now there\n",
       "10:10 is no support doing some uh voting uh\n",
       "10:14 procedure for example taking the\n",
       "10:16 different ensembles. Um therefore if you\n",
       "10:19 would like to use this uh approach and\n",
       "10:22 this procedure uh more deeper ones yeah\n",
       "10:25 then you need to go to the custom models\n",
       "10:27 and do it um yourself. Yeah. And of\n",
       "10:31 course um basically you uh doing your\n",
       "10:34 custom models you are not strictly uh\n",
       "10:37 stayed with one um library such as skyit\n",
       "10:41 learn you can use variety of the\n",
       "10:43 frameworks. So for example if you work\n",
       "10:45 with the images you can uh easily use\n",
       "10:47 tensorflow or kas or mxnet so there is a\n",
       "10:51 possibility of the ways what frameworks\n",
       "10:53 and for what type of tasks you can use\n",
       "10:57 um so let's start with the docker so\n",
       "11:00 here I put the uh picture um of course I\n",
       "11:05 uh think that there are a lot of people\n",
       "11:06 who and um I hope that there are a lot\n",
       "11:09 of people who already know the docker\n",
       "11:11 but we'll put uh some words about that.\n",
       "11:14 Um so basically Docker provides the um\n",
       "11:19 simplistic way how to uh package your\n",
       "11:21 code. Yeah. So by building the images.\n",
       "11:25 So uh Docker um give you the possibility\n",
       "11:29 to build the image based on so-called\n",
       "11:32 Docker file which is basically the text\n",
       "11:34 document where all of the commands are\n",
       "11:38 located. Yeah. So and this commands are\n",
       "11:40 using by docker during the uh building\n",
       "11:44 creation of the uh image itself. Yeah.\n",
       "11:47 And after creation of this image, this\n",
       "11:50 image can be uh running. Yeah. So and u\n",
       "11:54 running in the docker container.\n",
       "11:57 Um so basically if we're comparing this\n",
       "12:01 one uh this approach the dockerized\n",
       "12:03 approach with the other approach like\n",
       "12:06 using cond or using virtual enth yeah\n",
       "12:09 yeah like some other um virtual n\n",
       "12:13 approaches in python. Yeah. So we can\n",
       "12:14 see that u docker um is like a fully\n",
       "12:19 independent\n",
       "12:20 regarding the langu the language that\n",
       "12:22 you can use and it's also help you to\n",
       "12:25 create the whole um infrastructure the\n",
       "12:28 whole environment with the starting with\n",
       "12:30 the assigning environmental variables\n",
       "12:32 etc and in that way so you can think of\n",
       "12:36 a docker as a basically kind of\n",
       "12:38 lightweight version of uh virtual\n",
       "12:41 machine then you can use for packaging\n",
       "12:44 and then running your codes on the\n",
       "12:47 different services. So as in our case on\n",
       "12:50 AWS\n",
       "12:53 um so let's uh speak a bit regarding the\n",
       "12:58 uh structure of ML Docker for Sage\n",
       "13:02 Maker. So basically uh if you use docker\n",
       "13:07 so you cannot use it like um basically\n",
       "13:10 how you like yeah you should uh combine\n",
       "13:13 this with the uh with the predefined\n",
       "13:15 settings for um docker images in sage\n",
       "13:19 maker. So therefore on this picture you\n",
       "13:22 can see the structure\n",
       "13:25 uh which is using in sage maker which\n",
       "13:27 sagemaker estimator is using when it's\n",
       "13:30 uh working with the docker images. So\n",
       "13:33 here is the\n",
       "13:35 uh main folder called opt ml and\n",
       "13:38 basically it has three main folders\n",
       "13:41 three main channels it's uh input output\n",
       "13:45 and model. So what it is let's discuss\n",
       "13:48 it um let's discuss it uh right now. So\n",
       "13:53 regarding the input so regarding the\n",
       "13:55 input so we have here the information\n",
       "13:58 about the config. So for example here we\n",
       "14:01 can store the information about the\n",
       "14:02 hyperparameters of our ML model for\n",
       "14:05 example in the JSON format and then this\n",
       "14:08 information can be uh downloaded and\n",
       "14:12 using in the uh SageMaker estimator also\n",

       "18:22 uh you sending the u get request and uh\n",
       "18:29 if the service is alive and is working\n",
       "18:32 so you receive back the uh success\n",
       "18:36 status uh status code equal uh 200.\n",

       "19:55 Um to basically um summarize this point,\n",
       "20:01 let us check a bit regarding um VCG. So\n",
       "20:06 this is basically u so-called web server\n",
       "20:09 gateway interface and you can think of\n",
       "20:12 it as a bridge as I told. Yeah. So be uh\n",
       "20:15 between the u server side and between\n",
       "20:18 the application side which in our case\n",
       "20:21 would be flask web service. Yeah. Um so\n",
       "20:27 basically it works like that. So the\n",
       "20:29 server executes the web app and uh sends\n",
       "20:33 uh information and a callback function\n",
       "20:35 to the app. Yeah. So this is the start.\n",
       "20:38 Then the request is uh proceeded on the\n",
       "20:42 website and response is sent back uh to\n",
       "20:45 the server. Yeah. Utilizing uh uh\n",
       "20:48 callback function. So this is basically\n",
       "20:51 the basic principle how the uh how the\n",
       "20:54 VCGI is working.\n",
       "20:56 Um so basically example of the\n",
       "20:59 frameworks that is using VCGI um that\n",
       "21:03 supports VCGI there are a lot of them.\n",
       "21:05 Yeah. So for example we already uh\n",
       "21:08 spoken about flask we can also include\n",
       "21:12 um tornado to that the lightweight\n",
       "21:15 framework and also um something else\n",
       "21:18 like for example jungle yeah that is\n",
       "21:21 using for python web development mostly.\n",
       "21:26 Yeah. So uh basically right now uh we\n",
       "21:31 are ready to go to the content itself to\n",
       "21:34 the content of our repositories\n",
       "21:37 and before that let's um briefly discuss\n",
       "21:41 what we will have there and then we will\n",
       "21:43 go deeper and check the code of our\n",
       "21:47 files in the repository. So regarding\n",
       "21:49 the main components uh so the main\n",
       "21:51 components which we have in the root of\n",
       "21:53 our repository. So we have here docker\n",
       "21:56 file which we already mentioned that is\n",
       "21:59 uh text document file that contains all\n",
       "22:01 the required operations uh that docker\n",
       "22:05 use for uh producing the image via\n",
       "22:09 docker build command.\n",
       "22:11 Um then basically we have uh this age\n",

       "22:26 shell script uh is basically helping us\n",
       "22:31 to create to achieve two uh two aims\n",
       "22:35 yeah two goals. So the first uh we use\n",
       "22:39 this file to take the information about\n",
       "22:42 the account and about the region of our\n",
       "22:45 AWS service that we are using. Yeah. So\n",
       "22:48 that meaning that um before using this\n",
       "22:53 shell script we need to uh install\n",
       "22:55 pre-install AWS clement\n",
       "22:58 line interface in AWS and run comment\n",

       "23:07 installed uh AWS cle so you will receive\n",
       "23:10 four questions. So the first one will be\n",
       "23:14 uh please provide your public access key\n",
       "23:17 then please provide your private uh\n",
       "23:19 access key then please provide the\n",
       "23:21 region in which you are working uh on\n",
       "23:25 AWS and the fourth would be please\n",
       "23:27 provide the desirable format of the uh\n",
       "23:30 of the output. Yeah. So when you answer\n",
       "23:32 of all of these four questions so you\n",
       "23:34 can basically start using AWS cle and uh\n",
       "23:38 doing some operations let's say uh\n",
       "23:41 creating repositories yeah uh or\n",
       "23:44 creating some buckets on S3 yeah or\n",
       "23:48 listing the uh the um list of the EC2\n",
       "23:53 instances that is available on your\n",
       "23:55 account. This is basically the first\n",
       "23:58 goal which we are achieving using this\n",
       "24:01 uh shell script and um the second goal\n",
       "24:05 is basically the docker goal. So we need\n",
       "24:07 to uh build our docker and this shell\n",
       "24:11 script will actually help us to do that.\n",
       "24:12 So we will uh make we should make a\n",
       "24:15 docker build. Yeah, basically create our\n",
       "24:19 image. Then we need to make a docker\n",
       "24:21 tag. Put the uh tag uh with the\n",
       "24:25 information about the account and region\n",

       "24:31 latest to the image so that we would\n",

       "24:38 basically the latest image that\n",
       "24:40 SageMaker need to use and need to\n",
       "24:42 execute. Uh and uh the last step is\n",
       "24:45 basically docker push. So after creating\n",
       "24:48 the uh image after tagging so we are\n",
       "24:51 ready basically to make a docker push\n",
       "24:53 and afterwards uh this image is uh being\n",
       "24:58 pushed to the uh ECR uh repository. ECR\n",
       "25:03 is basically the service on AWS. It's um\n",

       "26:15 SageMaker estimator.\n",
       "26:18 Yeah. And regarding the uh container, so\n",
       "26:22 container application what is basically\n",
       "26:24 stored in our main folder of SageMaker\n",
       "26:26 estimator. So this is the uh two scripts\n",
       "26:30 which I told you before train and\n",

       "27:24 uh um so we can imagine this as a bottom\n",

       "27:30 wrapped in the flask application\n",
       "27:32 combining uh this to the u flask web\n",
       "27:36 services and then afterwards u the uh\n",
       "27:41 top layer and the top layer basically\n",
       "27:43 would be u as we discussed our server\n",
       "27:46 and jinx and our uh load balancer\n",
       "27:49 unicorn.\n",
       "27:51 Um therefore we need a couple more files\n",

       "28:27 Um so let's dive into the codes go\n",

       "28:34 the SageMaker estimator itself or this\n",
       "28:37 folder where we have our code. So uh we\n",
       "28:41 start from the bottom going to the top.\n",
       "28:43 So from the bottom. So this is our train\n",
       "28:47 uh scripts. So basically we here um\n",
       "28:51 making the simplistic way. So the\n",
       "28:53 simplistic way of um writing ML code in\n",
       "28:57 Python. So meaning that we need to uh be\n",
       "29:01 aware of having a lot of entities in uh\n",
       "29:04 one script, a lot of classes or a lot of\n",
       "29:06 functions. So and we trying to make the\n",
       "29:09 model structure uh simplistic model\n",
       "29:12 structure with uh not many entities\n",
       "29:15 inside of each of the structure. So for\n",
       "29:18 example here we for the training just\n",
       "29:20 use one uh function. So for example if\n",
       "29:24 we would like to introduce something\n",
       "29:25 more specific like a preprocessing here\n",
       "29:28 uh so it would be better to have the\n",
       "29:30 another script uh that we can combine\n",
       "29:33 with this one. So we import the\n",
       "29:35 libraries\n",
       "29:37 And here as I already mentioned we will\n",
       "29:39 work with the skyitle learn as our go-to\n",
       "29:41 framework. Um first of all and very\n",
       "29:45 important we need to specify the\n",

       "30:01 use uh while running our ML Docker\n",

       "30:18 it's like input output and the model\n",

       "30:31 the function train which is uh quite\n",

       "31:15 input file directory and uh checking\n",
       "31:18 whether are like files\n",
       "31:21 u existing there or not. Yeah. So uh\n",
       "31:23 basically if there are no files we're\n",
       "31:25 raising the error. If there are some\n",
       "31:26 files we just read them and prepare the\n",
       "31:29 x and y uh vectors for our training.\n",
       "31:34 Yeah. So um afterwards basically uh here\n",
       "31:38 is the example of why we actually need\n",
       "31:42 to use this custom approach. For example\n",
       "31:45 here we decided to use uh so-called\n",
       "31:48 voting classifier. Yeah. which is\n",
       "31:50 basically not introduced in Sage Maker\n",
       "31:53 uh from the scratch. Therefore, we uh\n",
       "31:56 use the custom approach. Yeah. So,\n",
       "31:58 voting classifier um we combine three\n",
       "32:01 models which is basically support vector\n",
       "32:03 machine with the probabilistic\n",
       "32:05 classifier. Yeah. Logistic regression\n",
       "32:07 and random forest classifier with a\n",
       "32:10 voting type equals soft meaning that we\n",
       "32:12 would uh not the predict classes itself.\n",
       "32:15 We will predict the probabilities and\n",
       "32:16 then based on the probabilities of these\n",
       "32:19 three models, three estimators. We will\n",
       "32:23 um understand the\n",
       "32:25 uh final probability uh by uh using mean\n",
       "32:29 of all of this average of all of this\n",
       "32:32 probabilities of all of this estimators.\n",
       "32:35 Then after defining the voting\n",
       "32:37 classifier, we need to um specify for\n",
       "32:40 example the grid search procedure\n",
       "32:42 because I mean um if you start with the\n",
       "32:46 this approach, it would be also nice to\n",
       "32:48 have um the um desirable parameters.\n",
       "32:53 Yeah, that's the the uh fitted\n",
       "32:55 parameters for your model. And basically\n",
       "32:57 we can do that in simplistic uh way\n",
       "33:02 using uh skyit learn grid search. Of\n",
       "33:05 course there are also other ways um\n",
       "33:08 possible but we keep it uh skyit learn\n",
       "33:11 style today. So therefore we actually\n",
       "33:14 after creating the voting classifier\n",
       "33:16 create the params grid uh and specifying\n",
       "33:19 the parameters and the range of the\n",
       "33:22 values that we need to check and we need\n",
       "33:24 to uh compare and then basically uh\n",
       "33:27 using grid search CV putting the\n",
       "33:29 estimators parameters and the desirable\n",
       "33:32 number of the uh cross validation steps.\n",
       "33:35 Then we feed the model and the result of\n",
       "33:37 this fitted model we just uh save um as\n",
       "33:41 a pickle dump\n",
       "33:44 um in the u uh in the file then this\n",
       "33:48 file we will use for the exact\n",
       "33:50 prediction. So this is also one very\n",
       "33:53 important uh point that uh sagemaker\n",
       "33:56 estimator is designed like that you need\n",
       "33:59 to use the main function without having\n",
       "34:02 the main function it won't work. Um so\n",
       "34:04 this is basically the uh the idea and\n",
       "34:07 the inner design of SageMaker that you\n",
       "34:10 need to put uh the main function and\n",
       "34:12 then put the function which you would\n",
       "34:14 like to execute uh during the run. So\n",
       "34:17 here for example we will execute only\n",
       "34:19 this uh function that we have the train\n",
       "34:21 function. This is regarding train\n",
       "34:24 scripts. Now we go to the uh predictor.\n",
       "34:27 Yeah. And the predictor in our case\n",
       "34:29 would be combined with the flask flask\n",
       "34:31 application. So first of all we also\n",
       "34:34 specifying the prefixes for the\n",
       "34:36 SageMaker ML Docker execution opt ML and\n",
       "34:40 uh setting the path to the model because\n",
       "34:43 we would like to um we would like to use\n",
       "34:47 the predefined weights for that. So\n",
       "34:50 basically take the weights and then use\n",
       "34:52 it for the prediction. And um after that\n",
       "34:55 we define the simple class\n",
       "34:59 um with the helper function let's say\n",
       "35:01 get model and predict. So why do we need\n",
       "35:04 that? So basically get model will help\n",
       "35:06 us to understand whether uh the model is\n",
       "35:09 exists whether we already having the uh\n",
       "35:12 fitted and saved uh information about\n",
       "35:14 our weights in a pickle format that we\n",
       "35:17 can take and if it's there we can just\n",
       "35:20 evoke the predict method and making the\n",
       "35:23 prediction against our endpoint. Yeah.\n",
       "35:27 So afterwards we just um specify the uh\n",
       "35:31 flask uh flask application and then\n",
       "35:34 basically uh the things has started.\n",
       "35:36 Yeah. So basically we identifying the\n",
       "35:40 roots the endpoints uh which we\n",
       "35:43 discussed uh before. So uh the endpoint\n",
       "35:46 called pink which u supports get method\n",
       "35:51 uh and uh endpoint invocation which\n",
       "35:53 supports uh post method. Yeah. So\n",
       "35:56 regarding ping so basically we check\n",
       "35:58 whether uh if our get model is not none\n",
       "36:03 then basically we receive status equal\n",
       "36:05 to 200 in case of success. If it's okay\n",
       "36:09 if it's none uh then we basically\n",
       "36:11 receive 404 in case of an error and send\n",
       "36:15 it as a flask response back to the\n",
       "36:17 client. uh then basically the main for\n",
       "36:20 us\n",
       "36:22 uh endpoint this invocation which is\n",
       "36:24 working with the\n",
       "36:26 with the post method. So we first of all\n",
       "36:30 checking our request from the flask\n",
       "36:33 regarding content type. This we do\n",
       "36:36 because the major of the SageMaker estim\n",
       "36:39 estimators are working with the uh text\n",
       "36:42 um / CSV format. Therefore, we need to\n",
       "36:46 check that prior to use it. Yeah. So, if\n",
       "36:49 it's text/ CSV, then we basically take\n",
       "36:52 this data uh using bytes and then\n",
       "36:56 basically read it as a CSV file and\n",
       "36:58 create the data. Otherwise, so if it's\n",
       "37:02 not a CSV format, then we uh send in the\n",
       "37:05 response that our predictor only\n",
       "37:08 supports CSV data. If it's go fine and\n",
       "37:11 we receive the data, so we can actually\n",
       "37:14 use it in the predict method of our\n",
       "37:17 scoring service class\n",
       "37:20 afterwards after creating the\n",
       "37:22 predictions. So we basically can um\n",
       "37:25 prepare them before actually send it\n",
       "37:28 back in the flask response to the\n",
       "37:30 client. So this is basically will be the\n",
       "37:32 response the results the success code\n",
       "37:34 and the type text CSV. So this is\n",
       "37:38 basically two scripts that uh creating\n",
       "37:40 the let's say the core of our program.\n",
       "37:43 So this is the major script that we\n",
       "37:45 always will be um will change you know\n",
       "37:48 during our work. Yeah. So this is the\n",
       "37:50 train procedure and predict with the\n",
       "37:53 flask application above. Yeah. So this\n",
       "37:55 is this combination creates the um web\n",
       "38:00 uh flask application. Yeah. So with the\n",
       "38:02 rest API\n",
       "38:04 structure. So then basically uh going to\n",
       "38:08 the top\n",
       "38:10 um and uh let's quickly look at the\n",
       "38:14 serve file. So the surf file uh I have\n",
       "38:17 to admit that is basically uh kind of\n",
       "38:20 going through the projects. Yeah. From\n",
       "38:22 one project to another project because\n",
       "38:24 uh usually there are not many things\n",
       "38:27 that you would um change on the server\n",
       "38:29 side. So of course you can change for\n",
       "38:31 example the timeout variable. Yeah. to\n",
       "38:35 be able to understand uh when you should\n",
       "38:38 uh kill the process for example kill the\n",
       "38:40 server uh or for example you should also\n",
       "38:44 be able to specify you can specify the\n",
       "38:46 number of workers that's uh um can\n",
       "38:50 execute for example defining the number\n",
       "38:53 of workers based on the multipprocessing\n",
       "38:55 CPU count yeah but uh otherwise it's\n",
       "38:59 pretty standard so the idea that here\n",
       "39:01 we're just starting the server uh which\n",
       "39:04 is starting the engine server and uh\n",
       "39:08 unicorn basically and it's after uh\n",
       "39:11 running it. So your server has started\n",
       "39:13 and uh is ready for receiving requests\n",
       "39:17 and sending back the u responses\n",
       "39:22 and uh basically the configuration of\n",
       "39:25 engin uh usually this is also say\n",
       "39:29 predefined and there's not many things\n",
       "39:31 that you would um change uh from project\n",
       "39:35 to project. Yeah. So of course you can\n",
       "39:37 change some things like uh worker\n",
       "39:39 processes. Yeah. But the main things or\n",
       "39:42 for example timeouts. Yeah. But the main\n",
       "39:44 things for example where the logs stored\n",
       "39:47 where the access logs or error logs are\n",
       "39:49 stored they mostly state the same from\n",
       "39:52 one project to another one. Um so this\n",
       "39:56 is basically the major um structure of\n",
       "40:00 the um of our folder with our code\n",
       "40:03 SageMaker estimator. Then basically we\n",
       "40:06 go back to the root directory and here\n",
       "40:09 we can see the uh basically the two\n",
       "40:12 files that would help us actually to\n",
       "40:15 build and deploy build and push sorry\n",
       "40:18 the um docker image to AWS. So let's\n",
       "40:23 start with the docker file. So the\n",
       "40:25 docker files look like that. So\n",
       "40:27 basically uh we using here operating\n",
       "40:31 system Ubuntu with certain version. Then\n",
       "40:34 basically we using run command for\n",
       "40:37 updating\n",
       "40:39 uh the packages on it and uh install the\n",
       "40:42 packages that we would uh like to use in\n",
       "40:45 this current uh orchestration. So for us\n",
       "40:48 um will be important to have our top\n",
       "40:51 four numpy pi panda skitler and uh so\n",
       "40:55 this is for the bottom layer and for the\n",
       "40:58 top layer we need to have n jinx uh\n",
       "41:00 flask and unicorn with gent afterwards\n",
       "41:04 we identifying the environment variables\n",
       "41:08 copy the main folder to the opt program\n",
       "41:11 and set it as a work directory. Then\n",
       "41:14 basically after this uh step all of the\n",
       "41:19 further on operation will be uh\n",
       "41:21 proceeding in this directory opt program\n",
       "41:24 uh as a work directory.\n",
       "41:27 Uh so this basically file will be used\n",
       "41:29 by docker build when we when we started\n",
       "41:33 and then basically the shell script\n",
       "41:35 docker to ECR. So how it's look like? So\n",
       "41:39 um as I already told it consist of two\n",
       "41:41 parts two logical parts. So the first\n",
       "41:43 part we working with the uh information\n",
       "41:47 of our um AWS account. So first of all\n",
       "41:51 we need to specify the name for our\n",
       "41:53 image which we would like to use and\n",
       "41:55 also afterwards we need to specify to\n",
       "41:58 get the information about the account u\n",
       "42:01 that we will use and the region. Yeah.\n",
       "42:04 So basically we here using AWS configure\n",
       "42:08 comment to get region for example.\n",
       "42:10 Therefore, it should be um identified\n",
       "42:12 beforehand to be able to use it um use\n",
       "42:16 it as it is because you need to specify\n",
       "42:17 your for example public and private key\n",
       "42:20 uh to be able to run this command. Um\n",
       "42:24 afterwards\n",
       "42:25 you create AWS ECR describe repository\n",
       "42:29 commands and if there is uh existing\n",
       "42:32 repository you just put it there. If\n",
       "42:34 it's not exist, you just create the\n",
       "42:36 repository in ECR\n",
       "42:39 u and take all this information. So this\n",
       "42:41 is basically the end of the part one.\n",
       "42:43 Then it's part two which is basically\n",
       "42:46 docker part. Then you go to the docker\n",
       "42:49 build. So you execute docker build\n",
       "42:51 command uh creating the image. Then you\n",
       "42:54 basically tag this image with the full\n",
       "42:57 name. So which is the information about\n",
       "42:59 your account, about your region, about\n",
       "43:02 the image name and about the uh tag\n",
       "43:05 latest which will help SageMaker\n",
       "43:07 understand uh what exact uh image uh it\n",
       "43:12 should use you know for production um\n",
       "43:15 the outcome and then the final step is\n",
       "43:18 docker push full name. So basically take\n",
       "43:21 the uh docker image and push it to the\n",
       "43:25 uh to this uh location to the full name\n",
       "43:27 account region uh image tag. Yeah. So\n",
       "43:32 and this is basically how it goes after\n",
       "43:36 we um run shell docker tor.shell\n",
       "43:41 and the name of our image. So for\n",
       "43:45 example here I use name called modeling.\n",
       "43:47 So we received this data uh this docker\n",
       "43:50 image in our ECR repository on AWS and\n",
       "43:54 afterwards basically we can start\n",
       "43:56 working with that. So let's go to the um\n",
       "43:59 AWS itself and uh I will show you how\n",
       "44:01 you can work with that. So um here is\n",
       "44:06 basically AWS HMaker. I think everybody\n",
       "44:09 or most of uh people has the experience\n",
       "44:14 with that seen that. So here is\n",
       "44:15 basically the uh notebook instances\n",
       "44:18 which you can use for which is basically\n",
       "44:20 the main uh thing for SageMaker. So and\n",
       "44:23 you can think of it as a let's say EC2\n",
       "44:26 instances like a virtual machine which\n",
       "44:28 has the predefined um installation such\n",
       "44:32 as Python such as Anaconda different\n",
       "44:35 versions yeah for example different\n",
       "44:37 other uh specific frameworks such as\n",
       "44:40 TensorFlow PyTorch\n",
       "44:43 um etc. Yeah. Uh so and basically um you\n",
       "44:47 can use uper notebooks there for running\n",
       "44:52 uh for doing research and doing the\n",
       "44:54 deployment. So usually this is the\n",
       "44:56 common procedure when you work on the\n",
       "45:00 Amazon SageMaker that you creating the\n",
       "45:02 notebook notebook on the instance and uh\n",
       "45:06 run your comments there. So let's go to\n",
       "45:08 the uh notebook and uh we'll see how it\n",
       "45:13 how we can work with that. So this is\n",
       "45:15 basically our notebook SageMaker\n",
       "45:18 estimator.\n",
       "45:20 So how it's uh how we should work with\n",
       "45:22 that. So basically um we should use the\n",
       "45:26 following libraries for us will be\n",
       "45:28 important also to use SageMaker\n",
       "45:30 libraries. Um this is the two important\n",
       "45:33 steps that we need to um identify our\n",
       "45:36 role. So get execution role um because\n",
       "45:39 the different roles in AWS have the\n",
       "45:41 different rights and accesses uh and\n",
       "45:44 then identify the SageMaker session.\n",
       "45:47 This will help us to uh run certain\n",
       "45:50 estimators. Yeah. So which we will do\n",
       "45:53 later on. So um beforehand we can\n",
       "45:56 actually connect to the S3 uh to the\n",
       "45:59 bucket which I prepared for this\n",
       "46:01 presentation and look at the data which\n",
       "46:03 we will using in this um in this uh code\n",
       "46:08 session. Yeah. So we read it and then\n",
       "46:11 basically can look at it with the head\n",
       "46:14 command. Yeah. So we have here is the u\n",
       "46:18 target variable binary uh hardware hard\n",
       "46:21 failure and also the other features that\n",
       "46:25 we will use in um in terms of our uh\n",
       "46:29 training. Yeah. So here is the info\n",
       "46:33 commands. So it's quite small data set\n",
       "46:35 for presentational\n",
       "46:38 um purposes and then basically we go to\n",
       "46:41 the uh to the most interesting part.\n",
       "46:44 Yeah. So right now we uh using both 3\n",
       "46:47 which is basically the library that's\n",
       "46:49 enabling uh programming API between\n",
       "46:52 Python 3 from one side and AWS from\n",
       "46:55 another side. We uh using STS uh having\n",
       "46:59 the information about the account which\n",
       "47:02 we are using and about the region uh in\n",
       "47:05 which the model will be hosted. Then uh\n",
       "47:09 we specify uh image URI. This is\n",
       "47:12 basically the location where uh we can\n",

       "52:10 start from this part. Yeah. So we're\n",
       "52:12 starting with the identifying the\n",

       "53:27 structured yeah so we get the data from\n",
       "53:29 the um from our request or JSON request\n",
       "53:33 and put it to the uh payload. So we take\n",
       "53:37 the data from uh so it's like coming in\n",

       "59:02 Yeah thanks Mitri. Uh yes we do have a\n",

       "59:13 the rest in in Slack.\n",
       "59:15 Yeah.\n",
       "59:15 So first the most popular question is\n",
       "59:18 how models are updated. Sage Maker\n",
       "59:20 doesn't allow redeploying models with\n",
       "59:22 the same endpoint name.\n",

       "59:27 this?\n",
       "59:28 Uh basically this are couple of things\n",
       "59:30 how uh there's a couple of ways how you\n",
       "59:32 can do that. So before the um um\n",
       "59:35 existing of step functions uh basically\n",
       "59:38 the only way how you can do that it was\n",
       "59:40 the using uh extensive using of lambda\n",
       "59:44 functions. So you use lambda function\n",
       "59:45 for um let's say retraining and adding\n",
       "59:49 this in the end of retraining job to\n",
       "59:51 update the uh certain certain endpoint\n",
       "59:55 that was like a uh was a big problem big\n",
       "59:58 issue. Therefore uh recently so around\n",
       "1:00:02 one year um ago so the step function for\n",
       "1:00:06 Sage Maker were announced and basically\n",
       "1:00:09 this is uh also from AWS considered to\n",
       "1:00:13 be as a main approach. So you use step\n",
       "1:00:16 functions and uh you use them for\n",
       "1:00:19 basically creating the retraining uh of\n",
       "1:00:23 your model that will be also updating\n",
       "1:00:25 your um endpoint because I also know\n",
       "1:00:28 that this is the very important\n",
       "1:00:29 questions uh because there are lots of\n",
       "1:00:32 question on the forums on the uh stock\n",
       "1:00:34 overflow regarding that and not many\n",
       "1:00:36 answers about that. Yeah. So actually\n",
       "1:00:38 the principle right now that is um that\n",
       "1:00:41 you can use step functions for doing\n",
       "1:00:43 that and for\n",
       "1:00:46 uh to make the process automate to\n",
       "1:00:49 automate the process you can uh use\n",
       "1:00:52 either lambda functions or uh basically\n",
       "1:00:55 cloudatch to make uh kind of\n",
       "1:00:58 scheduleuler scheduleuler to make it um\n",
       "1:01:01 automate. Yeah. So this is basically um\n",
       "1:01:06 the main process and the second way how\n",
       "1:01:10 you can do that it's using airflow for\n",
       "1:01:13 example and this is basically the our\n",
       "1:01:15 idea of the next talk so if it's this\n",
       "1:01:18 point I guess uh will be interesting for\n",
       "1:01:21 many of you so we can basically uh cover\n",
       "1:01:23 it in the next session and discuss\n",
       "1:01:26 regarding step function as a main\n",
       "1:01:28 approach and uh cover a bit uh airflow\n",
       "1:01:31 topic\n",
       "1:01:33 Okay.\n",
       "1:01:34 Can I further clarify on this? Um, so\n",
       "1:01:37 when you're changing when you update the\n",
       "1:01:39 model and endpoint, do you control the\n",
       "1:01:42 endpoint uh and the swapping of the\n",
       "1:01:43 endpoint on your SageMaker end or does\n",
       "1:01:46 your app have to know which endpoint to\n",
       "1:01:50 call every time you update a model? I'm\n",

       "1:01:55 allow you for that or you have to build\n",
       "1:01:57 it outside of it? So basically right now\n",
       "1:01:59 so once again so basically beforehand it\n",
       "1:02:03 was really a big issue. Yeah it's just\n",
       "1:02:06 like you need to use a lot of lambda\n",

Um\\n6:20 so what will be the uh contents of this\\n6:23 meeting? So we will um discuss regarding\\n6:27 the docker itself. So what it is in a\\n6:31 quick words. So how um how men um can\\n6:35 use that and u um so how you can use\\n6:39 that also in the uh AWS hagemaker\\n6:42 um infrastructure. Then we basically\\n6:44 talk we'll talk about the um ML model\\n6:48 structure. So and how basically we can\\n6:50 combine the uh docker itself with the ML\\n6:54 model structure. We talk a bit about um\\n6:57 basically flask application and rest uh\\n7:01 API services that we can basically use\\n7:04 for u building our web models. Uh then\\n7:08 afterwards we will talk a bit about the\\n7:11 execution stack. So how exactly\\n7:14 SageMaker will execute your docker\\n7:16 container with your code. Then a couple\\n7:19 words about ECG. So um regarding the web\\n7:23 server gateway interface. So basically\\n7:25 the interface that will help us uh in\\n7:28 our application to connect our server\\n7:31 side and our model site. So um then a\\n7:36 couple of words about the structure of\\n7:38 this repositories about the main\\n7:40 components and the structure of our uh\\n7:43 container application of our code. Um\\n7:45 basically yeah so um let's start\\n7:51 um let's start with th\", 'video_id': '2ZOnA19sDpM'}, {'start': 4000, 'content': \"y this is our let's say standard\\n5:23 platform\\n5:25 uh for the research and for the\\n5:27 deployment of the models. Yeah. And uh\\n5:29 basically the topic that I would like to\\n5:31 discuss today uh we also um you know use\\n5:36 extensively in our work. So we uh create\\n5:40 the dockerized ML models and uh uh push\\n5:45 them to the AWS and then uh deploy using\\n5:49 AWS SageMaker.\\n5:51 So uh what will be the let's say the\\n5:53 topic and the uh let's say the content\\n5:56 of our uh today meeting. So I prepared\\n6:02 the uh small repository for this\\n6:04 meeting.

       "                <div><p>In the video, the discussion about <strong>API Gateway in SageMaker</strong> outlines how it is implemented in conjunction with AWS Lambda and a machine learning model deployed on SageMaker.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Key Points on API Gateway Implementation:</h3>\n",
       "<ol>\n",
       "<li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>The API Gateway serves as a conduit that enables you to invoke the SageMaker endpoint to get predictions from your deployed model.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li><p><strong>Data Handling</strong>:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>The data is formatted into a payload that is sent as a JSON request. This payload contains key-value pairs, where specific keys are directly mapped to input features required by the machine learning model.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li><p><strong>Invocation of Endpoint</strong>:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>To invoke the SageMaker endpoint, you need to specify the endpoint name within your environment variables. This includes defining the content type (e.g., <code>text/csv</code>) and the body of the request as the payload.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li><p><strong>REST API Service</strong>:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>The tutorial indicates using REST API services through an API Gateway to implement the API. Specifically, a <strong>POST request</strong> is needed to interact with the SageMaker invocation endpoint. This is crucial for sending the input data and receiving the predicted variable.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li><p><strong>Lambda Function Integration</strong>:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>The API Gateway needs to be combined with a Lambda function. The Lambda function will handle the API requests, invoke the SageMaker endpoint, and return the predictions back to the caller.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li><p><strong>Testing</strong>:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>After setting up the API Gateway and Lambda function, you can test the integration by sending requests to the API and seeing the responses.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "</ol>\n",
       "<h3>Example Workflow:</h3>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li><p><strong>Create the API Gateway</strong>:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Set up the endpoint to handle POST requests.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li><p><strong>Lambda Function Setup</strong>:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>This function reads the incoming request, extracts the features from the payload, and calls the SageMaker invoke endpoint.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li><p><strong>Return the Predictions</strong>:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>The function retrieves the prediction results and sends them back to the API Gateway, which in turn responds to the client.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusion:</h3>\n",
       "<p>The integration of API Gateway with SageMaker simplifies deploying machine learning models and makes them accessible via a standardized REST API interface. This allows for scalability and ease of use in applications needing predictive analytics.</p>\n",
