Basically, when you shop on Zalando and you get an invoice and the payment method, that's exactly my team who built the algorithm behind that, to enable you to buy with this payment method.

You go there as an individual, you need to identify yourself as a CEO or a CTO, and then it's kind of like speed dating – speed co-founding.

I also was there at Zalando Payments, where I was building real-time machine learning systems for fraud prediction and payment scoring. Basically, when you shop on Zalando and you get an invoice and the payment method, that's exactly my team who built the algorithm behind that, to enable you to buy with this payment method.

You go there as an individual, you need to identify yourself as a CEO or a CTO, and then it's kind of like speed dating – speed co-founding.
