This GitHub page is the main entry point to our course and um yeah I think it's more or less self-explanatory. If you want to sign up this is the button you click and the actual course starts in on September 15th. it means that it's uh slightly less than one one month before the course starts and the purpose of today's um session is to just answer your questions. So you have some questions and uh you can ask these questions using uh you can ask your questions using the pinned link. So there's a pinned link in the live chat. Click on that link um and there ask your questions. So yeah, this is how it looks like and I am just going to uh use this thing. So we can also go to SLO and use ML Zoom camp and I'm going to use that for answering questions. Uh one thing though, so before we start, I just wanted to mention that um this course has been running for uh this will be the fifth edition of this course. So we've been doing this course for quite some time. Many people already graduated from this course and um most of the content we use here is the content I uh recorded like four years ago but we are updating the content so cuz u back then everyone was using Python 3.8 eight or nine something like. So yeah, we are re-recording some of the things in particular. Module one, two, three, four will uh stay the same cuz uh this uh these are the fundamentals. They didn't change. But module five we uh will update. Module 6 will stay the same. Module 8 we will update. Module 9 update update. And this we will not include like we only include it once and this thing get outdated very fast. So we just I just didn't bother updating this at all and it's pretty advanced material.

Many people already graduated from this course and um most of the content we use here is the content I uh recorded like four years ago but we are updating the content so cuz u back then everyone was using Python 3.8 eight or nine something like. So yeah, we are re-recording some of the things in particular. Module one, two, three, four will uh stay the same cuz uh this uh these are the fundamentals. They didn't change. But module five we uh will update. Module 6 will stay the same. Module 8 we will update. Module 9 update update. And this we will not include like we only include it once and this thing get outdated very fast. So we just I just didn't bother updating this at all and it's pretty advanced material. So we will update like four out of 10 modules. So that's the plan. Uh and we already had some workshops for this. Anyways um you have some questions and these questions you use slido for asking these questions and let's get started. Um Alexi question is there a chance of job placement after the program? How deep are we going into computer vision and rock? Okay, so there are three questions actually here. Uh chance of job placement. So we do not provide you job placement. So we are not recruiters. We just teach this uh and we are not a boot camp where you pay money. Right? So this is a free boot camp and our resources are limited. So we cannot really uh do this for you. That said, many of many course participants who took this course in the past successfully found the job. So this is this is going to be the fifth time we are hosting this. So yeah, many many people have graduated from this course and many people found the jobs. So yes, there is a high chance to find a job placement after the program because the teach we the skills we teach here the skills we cover here they are the most important skills for a machine learning engineer.

That's why it's more like an engineering program, ML engineering program. And with these skills, usually people don't have any problems finding a job. How deep are we going into computer vision and rack? Okay. So we don't go deep into computer vision. We have one module on deep learning and in this deep learning module we uh do we build an image classifier. So this is a model that can classify different types of clothes into images of of clothes into 10 different categories like pants, like shirts, like t-shirts, stuff like that. So this is as uh deep as we go to computer vision. So that's only one module about that. And we also talk about deploying neural networks.

Uh so actually this course is based on a book I wrote machine learning book amp. So this is the book website. Uh I think I can share it here. Yeah. And then let me put it also here. So this course is based on the book. Uh but the book was written more than 5 years ago or like it was finished around uh maybe half a year before the course or maybe a year before the course was recorded. Um so yeah the some of the some parts of the book are slightly outdated. So this is what I'm going to fix right now um with this course. In this course we are reording some of the materials. So because the book is outdated you will find the examples you have in this course uh before the update. So we still use u flask there. Instead of fast fast API for example we use tensorflow there. Instead of PyTorch, we use Python 3.7 maybe like a relatively old uh Python instead of 3.13 and so on. But um the the course is\"}]\n"
